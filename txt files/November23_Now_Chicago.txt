Full text: In Georgia, protesters waving European Union flags have rallied against what they see as their pro-Russia leaders. Moldova's government is pushing to join the bloc, enraging citizens hoping for closer relations with Russia. Armenia, too, has reached out to Europe, angered that Russia, a longtime ally, is courting its enemy, Azerbaijan.
Fueled in part by the Ukraine war, tensions have been mounting within some of the former lands of the Soviet Union, pitting those favoring closer relations with Russia against those orientated more toward Europe.
Many of those tensions predate the war, rooted in long-standing domestic struggles over power, money and other issues, but they have been amplified by geopolitics, with both Russia and the West pushing countries to choose a side.
Across the former Soviet Union "the whole context is now shaped by how the Ukraine war has radicalized competition between Russia and the West," said Gerard Toal, author of "Near Abroad," a study of Russia's relations with former Soviet territories.
Fearful of losing influence, Moscow has issued blunt warnings to countries such as Georgia and Moldova: Remember what happened in Ukraine. Without threatening to invade either country, it has pointed to the tumult and bloodshed that followed Ukraine's tilt toward the West after a popular revolt in 2014 ousted its pro-​Russian president.
Russia is also hoping that recent successes on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine can help reverse the many setbacks it suffered to its prestige and influence in a string of former Soviet states earlier in the war.
"Russian information campaigns have been fueling this idea that closer alignment with the West threatens a war that only Russia can win," said Nicu Popescu, the former foreign minister of Moldova. "Everything depends on Ukraine."
With the war's outcome looking increasingly uncertain, "Russia is enjoying the West's discomfort," said Thomas de Waal, an expert on the former Soviet Union with Carnegie Europe, a research group.
Russia has much ground to regain, and some of its losses may be irreversible.
Distracted by the war and determined to expand relations with Azerbaijan, a rising energy power, Moscow last year alienated one of its closest allies, Armenia, by ordering Russian peacekeepers to stand aside when Azeri troops took over Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed mountain enclave. Armenia later said it was considering applying to join the European Union and leaving a Moscow-led security pact.
Moldova has ramped up its efforts to join the EU, which in 2022 granted it candidate status.
Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Moldova to show U.S. support for Ukraine and neighbors that could potentially be at risk.
But even in Georgia -- which was invaded by Russia in 2008, lost 20% of its territory to Moscow-backed separatists and harbors deep anti-Russian sentiments -- a substantial minority still want to improve at least economic ties with Russia.
"This is not because they like Russia but because they are afraid of Russia," said Koba Turmanidze, director of the Caucasus Research Resource Center, a research group in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
The Georgian government, though officially striving to join the European Union, a goal widely supported by the population, has used fear of Russian retaliation to try to justify its refusal to join European sanctions against Moscow.
The governing party, Georgian Dream, Turmanidze said, would never say it is siding with Russia against Ukraine because "that would be political suicide," given public hostility to Moscow.
But it has taken steps, notably a controversial law on foreign influence that set off weeks of street protests, that "are Russian in style," he added.
Maintaining influence over former Soviet lands has been a goal of Moscow since the early 1990s but was given new emphasis in a revised "foreign policy concept" signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year.
The document committed Russia to preventing "color revolutions," Moscow's term for popular uprisings "and other attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of Russia's allies and partners" and "preventing and countering unfriendly action of foreign states."
Casting recent street protests in Georgia as a replay of what, in Moscow's view, was a CIA-orchestrated coup in 2014 in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned last week that the demonstrations in Tbilisi were "just like what happened in Ukraine."
And "look how the situation is developing in Moldova," the ministry's spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, added, referring to tensions there before an October referendum on joining the European Union. Opinion is divided in Moldova between those who favor closer integration with Europe and those looking to Russia.
"This looks like the very scenario that was prepared by Western masters for Ukraine," Zakharova said.
The 2014 street protests in Kyiv, Ukraine, that toppled Ukraine's elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, were triggered by public outrage over his rejection of a trade and political deal with the European Union that he had pledged to sign.
"Russia's general narrative is that there is a geopolitical conspiracy by the West to subvert the sovereignty of independent states," Toal said.
The West, too, has its own Ukraine-framed story, one that Blinken recited last week in Moldova.
"Moldovans are acutely aware that what happens in Ukraine matters not just to Ukrainians, but to Moldovans too," Blinken said at a news conference with Moldova's president, Maia Sandu. Left unchallenged, he said, Russia "would not stop at Ukraine."
A few weeks earlier, customs officers at Moldova's international airport found more than $1 million in cash in the luggage of some Russia-aligned politicians returning from Moscow.
Popescu, who stepped down as Moldova's foreign minister in January and is now a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the money was for financing political activities before the October referendum and a presidential election at the same time.
"You are allowed to do politics, but you cannot bring in bags of cash from Russia," he said.
He said military intervention in Moldova by Moscow, a fear at the start of the invasion of Ukraine, has receded. But recent advances by Russian troops "are a worry," he added. "They are still a long way from us, but everything hinges on the outcome of the war."

Full text: The war in Ukraine has seen its fair share of twists and turns over the last 27 months. The first year was largely defined by the Russian army's highly public missteps, from gas-less tanks stranded on the roadside to Russian soldiers redeploying to the Donbas after a failed push to take Kyiv. Then came Ukraine's swift September 2022 counteroffensive in Kharkiv. The Ukrainians were riding high in November 2022, so much so that U.S. intelligence agencies picked up chatter that Russian generals were talking about the use of tactical nuclear warheads.
The situation, however, has deteriorated for the Ukrainians ever since. The capture of Kherson in November 2022 was the high-water mark of Ukraine's progress. Since then, the battlefield situation has slowly rebounded to Russia's advantage. Moscow has regained more territory over the last two months than Ukraine did during its entire counteroffensive last year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is frustrated by Russia's current operations in Kharkiv, leading Washington to loosen its ban on using U.S.-supplied weapons to hit targets inside Russia.
All of this leads to the inevitable question: At what point should Ukraine shift its strategy from total military victory toward a good-enough peace?
For many, even talking about the possibility of a diplomatic settlement with Russia is blasphemy. Russia, after all, is the aggressor, invading a sovereign neighbor and committing countless atrocities in the process. Its president, Vladimir Putin, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Ukraine is the victim, the logic goes, and forcing it to sit down at the same table with its victimizer leaves a sour taste in our mouths.
All of that may be true to a degree. International politics, though, isn't a morality contest -- it's at times an ugly, highly competitive slugfest between states where the ideal is rarely attainable.
To date, Zelenskyy has been adamant: Ukraine will only negotiate with Russia after it withdraws its troops from every inch of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation for more than a decade. Zelenskyy's 10-point peace plan, which demands a total Russian military withdrawal, Russian compensation for war damage and war crime prosecutions for Russian soldiers, is in effect a surrender document for Moscow. Zelenskyy will reiterate those same terms this month, when dozens of countries assemble in Switzerland for a so-called peace summit.
Yet that plan, although desirable, is simply not credible. In fact, given the current state of the war, as well as Putin's willingness to sacrifice Russia's future to maintain the roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy, Zelenskyy's position is downright delusional. This is one of the worst-kept secrets in international relations, one the Biden administration likely recognizes behind the scenes.
The White House, of course, is highly unlikely to state this obvious fact openly. First, doing so would cause extreme strain between Washington and Kyiv at a time when both are working to hold Ukraine's defensive lines. Second, the U.S. would be embarrassing Zelenskyy by in essence calling his peace proposal a fool's errand. And the impact on morale within the Ukrainian army could be significant -- who would risk their life for a draw?
But none of these considerations outweigh the facts on and off the battlefield -- and whether we like it or not, those facts now favor Russia. While Russia's casualties are steep -- the U.K. Ministry of Defense estimates that 465,000 Russians have been killed or wounded thus far -- the Russian government is preparing for a war that could last for years. Putin is consistently throwing bodies into the fight -- approximately 30,000 Russians are joining the ranks every month -- and is providing lucrative bonuses and benefits to entice more young men to join. Despite stringent U.S. and European Union sanctions, Russia has managed to redirect its crude to the east (mainly to China and India), garnering tens of billions of dollars for the treasury. The Russian economy is sustaining the war effort just as the war is sustaining the Russian economy.
Ukraine, like Russia, doesn't have unlimited resources. But unlike Russia, it has less of pretty much everything -- less fighting-aged men, less artillery shells available and less wealth to spend on a war that continues to churn with no end in sight. The Ukrainian army is stretched along a 600-mile frontline that has only gotten longer after Russia's latest push into Kharkiv, forcing Kyiv to redirect troops that would otherwise be reinforcing the line in the Donbas. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy remains hesitant to call a general mobilization to give soldiers fighting at the front continuously for the last two years the time to rest, lest it spur political turmoil in Kyiv or further shrink the Ukrainian workforce.
None of this is to suggest that Zelenskyy should wave the white flag. Nothing is inevitable in war; the side that makes territorial gains this week could very well be retreating the next. The $61 billion infusion of new U.S. aid to Ukraine is just starting to pour in, and the Ukrainians will want to see whether the latest tranche will enable them to recover lost ground. Any diplomatic settlement will also depend on Putin -- if the Russian president refuses to actually compromise, then there won't be much for Ukraine to talk about.
But it's long past time for observers of this war and U.S. policymakers who are involved in it to drop their delusions about total military victory. Like most wars in history, this one will end through a diplomatic process with which none of the sides will be particularly enamored. The only question is how exhausted Ukraine and Russia need to become to finally negotiate seriously.

Full text: With Ukraine's second-largest city bracing for a new Russian offensive, a growing number of NATO allies are backing Ukraine's pleas to allow its forces to conduct strikes in Russian territory with Western weapons.
President Joe Biden has decided to let Ukraine use American weapons against military targets in Russia to blunt the Kharkiv offensive, days after Canada decided to allow the use of arms it has supplied. More than a dozen have given similar permission to Ukraine.
The United States, the most important supplier of weaponry to Ukraine, had been reluctant to take the step, worried about provoking Russia into an escalation that could drag in NATO and set off a wider war. Without sign-off from Washington, the U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, can strike Russian targets only inside Ukraine.
Yet many Western leaders and military analysts say that with Russia massing thousands of troops on its side of the border -- less than 20 miles from the northeastern city of Kharkiv -- Ukraine badly needs the authority to strike inside Russia with Western weapons. The permission from Biden is intended solely for Ukraine to attack military sites in Russia being used for the Kharkiv offensive, U.S. officials said.
"Russian commanders are well aware of Ukraine's inability to strike back," Peter Dickinson, a Ukraine analyst at the Atlantic Council in Washington, wrote in an analysis published before Biden's policy change.
Officials and experts say that launching missiles into Russia, striking its troops, bases, airfields and supply lines, could pay immediate dividends.
Indeed, the Ukrainian military already appears to be preparing to launch some initial strikes, "to test out the Russian response," Rafael Loss, a weapons expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview Thursday.
But Ukraine and the NATO allies have been reluctant to shoulder the risk of changing tactics without U.S. approval, Loss said. "The United States ultimately would carry a lot of the burden of responding if there was a significant escalation by Russia, for example, against NATO territory."
Recently, Russia conducted an array of aerial attacks with cruise missiles, drones and ballistic missiles, Ukraine's air force said Thursday, while the chief of the army said Russia is increasing its troop concentration in the Kharkiv region where Moscow's forces have made significant advances in a spring offensive.
Ukrainian army chief Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi said on his Facebook page Thursday that Russia is bringing units into the Kharkiv region from other parts of Ukraine to supplement forces in the two main flashpoints of fighting, the towns of Vovchansk and Lyptsi. Syrskyi said Ukraine also has moved reserve troops into the area.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Western nations are stepping up their calls to allow attacks on Russian territory using weapons that they have sent the Ukrainian military -- an issue that is taking on greater urgency as Russia builds up troops on the border in preparation for a possible offensive.
On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Ukraine should be allowed to target the military sites used by Russia to fire missiles and launch attacks at Ukraine. His comments followed similar calls in recent days by NATO's top official, Jens Stoltenberg, and government ministers in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden.
Ukrainian officials say that Russia has amassed some 10,000 troops across from the northeastern Ukrainian region of Sumy, in preparation for a possible ground offensive, and that their hands will be tied unless they can strike across the border.
The calls to allow Ukraine to expand its use of the Western weapons are mostly directed at the United States.
Washington has repeatedly asked Ukraine not to fire U.S.-made weapons into Russian territory for fear of escalating the war, although a debate has now opened within the Biden administration over relaxing the ban.
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Tuesday that Western countries helping Ukraine strike into Russia should be aware of "what they're playing with."
He added that small European countries calling for strikes on Russia should bear in mind that they are densely populated nations, making what appeared to be a threat against them.
Ukraine has complained that the ban allows Russian forces to launch attacks from inside Russian territory without risk and hampers its ability to repel them.
For now, the Ukrainian military has limited itself to using Western weapons to hit targets in Russian-occupied territory within Ukraine.
Latvia is one of several countries in Europe that have recently called to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons against Russian territory. Going a step further, Britain and Sweden have suggested that Ukraine could use their weapons to strike inside Russia.
Stoltenberg said Tuesday that each country that sent weapons to Ukraine could decide whether to limit usage and that it was not up to NATO to say which Western arms could strike within Russia's sovereign territory.
Ohio ballot deadline: President Joe Biden will be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee through a virtual roll call ahead of the party's official convention in Chicago in August -- a maneuver that will allow Biden to appear on the November ballot in Ohio.
The Democratic National Convention, where Biden would otherwise be formally nominated, comes after Ohio's ballot deadline of Aug. 7. The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19 to 22.
Ohio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so for Biden this year and were called to a rare special session by Gov. Mike DeWine to address the issue.
The virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Chicago, Democrats will still hold a state-by-state roll call that is a fixture of nominating conventions, according to a Democratic National Committee official, although it would largely be ceremonial and it's unclear how that in-person roll call would commence.
The DNC on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules-and-bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is set for next Tuesday.
"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states," Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement.
Ohio lawmakers gathered Tuesday for the special session.
Georgian bill: The Georgian parliament on Tuesday overrode a presidential veto of the "foreign agents" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.
The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.
The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as "pursuing the interests of a foreign power" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.
Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and "hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world."
The veto was rejected by an 84-4 vote in a contentious parliament session.
Holiday storm toll: Strong storms with damaging winds and baseball-size hail pummeled Texas on Tuesday, leaving more than 1 million businesses and homes without power as much of the U.S. recovered from severe weather, including tornadoes, that killed at least 24 people during the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
Widespread outages were reported in north Texas, which includes Dallas and Fort Worth, where a heat wave added to the misery. More than 300,000 customers in Dallas County alone lacked electricity Tuesday as the outages extended into rural east Texas, according to PowerOutage.us.
Around Houston, cars crawled through flooded highways, and more than 300,000 customers were without power in the area, which includes parts still recovering from hurricane-force winds earlier this month.
Storms over the weekend caused deaths in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia.
Deadly SD shootings: Three people were shot to death in a small South Dakota town, and a former law officer who once served as the mayor of Centerville is charged in the killings.
Jay Ostrem, 64, was jailed on $1 million cash-only bond on three counts of first-degree murder, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said Tuesday in a news release. It wasn't clear if Ostrem had an attorney.
A probable cause affidavit identified the victims as two brothers, ages 26 and 21, and a 35-year-old man.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has begun releasing prisoners to serve in its army, part of a wider effort to rebuild a military that has been depleted by more than two years of war and is strained by relentless Russian assaults.
Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said Friday that nearly 350 prisoners have been freed under a law enacted last week that allows convicts to serve in the army in exchange for the possibility of parole at the end of their service.
The country's courts must approve each prisoner's bid to enlist, and Maliuska said the judiciary was already considering most of the 4,300 applications submitted so far. Up to 20,000 such applicants, including people who were in pretrial detention, could be recruited to join the hundreds of thousands of soldiers already serving in Ukraine's military, he said.
The policy echoes a practice widely used by Russia to bolster its forces, but differs in some ways. Russia's program is open to prisoners convicted of violent crimes, while the Ukrainian law does not extend to people convicted of two or more murders, rape or other serious offenses.
Several Ukrainian lawmakers initially said that people convicted of premeditated murder would not be eligible. But Maliuska clarified Friday that someone convicted of a single murder could be released, unless the crime was committed with aggravating circumstances such as sexual violence.
"There is some similarity, but I can't say that this is the same as Russia did," Maliuska said.
Ukraine had mocked Russia's push to recruit prisoners in exchange for parole earlier in the war. But with the conflict now in its third year and with Ukrainian forces struggling all along the front line, Ukraine desperately needs more soldiers.
"The deficit of soldiers -- of course, the difficulties with the draft of ordinary citizens -- those were the main reasons for the law," Maliuska said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war -- a figure that is well below estimates by U.S. officials, who said in August that nearly 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed at that point.
In recent months, Ukraine has stepped up border patrols to catch anyone trying to avoid being drafted and lowered the draft eligibility age to 25 from 27. It has not drafted younger men, to avoid hollowing out an already small generation of men in their 20s, the result of a demographic crisis stretching back more than a century.
Most recently, Ukraine passed a law requiring all men of military age to ensure that the government had current details about their address and health status. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said this week that about 700,000 people had updated their details on an online platform.
Ukraine's urgent need for additional troops has become particularly apparent since Russian forces opened a new front in the northeast of the country two weeks ago, near the city of Kharkiv. The offensive by Moscow has stretched Ukrainian forces and compelled them to redeploy units from other hot spots of the front line, weakening their defenses there.
Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine's commander in chief, said Friday that Russian forces were trying to break through Ukrainian defenses in the southeastern Donetsk region.
Visiting Kharkiv on Friday, Zelenskyy also highlighted in a social media post the difficult situation in Vovchansk, a small town near the Russian border that Moscow's troops have been attacking for the past two weeks, targeting it with heavy bombs and engaging in street fighting.
This week, a court in the western city of Khmelnytsky said that it had freed more than 50 prisoners under the law allowing for the recruitment of inmates. It said most of the prisoners who had applied for conditional release to join the military were young men convicted of theft, and many had relatives and friends who had died in the war, motivating them to join the fight.
The move to recruit prisoners has drawn little criticism from the Ukrainian public, with many civilians and lawmakers saying convicts have a duty to defend their country like any other citizen.
It remains unclear how Ukraine's military will use its new recruits. The authorities said the prisoners would also be integrated into special units and that they would not be released until the end of the war.
The court in Khmelnytsky said in a statement that a large number of prisoners "do not want to be released on parole" under the law. Maliuska said he expected many to wait and see what happened with the first wave of inmates joining the army.
They want to know "what is the quality of the training, whether the new soldiers and ex-inmates are satisfied, whether they're treated properly," Maliuska said. "That will be key."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Since the first American shipments of sophisticated weapons to Ukraine, President Joe Biden has never wavered on one prohibition: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had to agree to never fire them into Russian territory, insisting that it would violate Biden's mandate to "avoid World War III."
But the consensus on that policy is fraying. Propelled by the State Department, there is now a vigorous debate inside the administration over relaxing the ban to allow the Ukrainians to hit missile and artillery launch sites just over the border in Russia -- targets that Zelenskyy says have enabled Moscow's recent territorial gains.
The proposal, pressed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken after a sobering visit last week to Kyiv, Ukraine, is still in the formative stages, and it is not clear how many of his colleagues among Biden's inner circle have signed on. It has not yet been formally presented to the president, who has traditionally been the most cautious, officials said.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller declined to comment on the internal deliberations over Ukraine policy, including Blinken's report after his return from Kyiv.
But officials involved in the deliberations said Blinken's position had changed because the Russians had opened a new front in the war, with devastating results. Russia's forces have placed weapons right across the border from northeastern Ukraine and aimed them at Kharkiv -- knowing that the Ukrainians would only be able to use non-American drones and other weaponry to target them in response.
For months, Zelenskyy has been mounting attacks on Russian ships, oil facilities and electricity plants, but he has been doing so largely with Ukrainian-made drones, which don't pack the power and speed of the American weapons. And increasingly, the Russians are shooting down the Ukrainian drones and missiles or sending them astray, thanks to improved electronic warfare techniques.
Now pressure is mounting on the United States to help Ukraine target Russian military sites, even if Washington wants to maintain its ban on attacking oil refineries and other Russian infrastructure with U.S.-provided arms. Britain, usually in lockstep with the United States on war strategy, has quietly lifted its own restrictions so that its "Storm Shadow" cruise systems can be used to target Russia more broadly.
The United States is now considering training Ukrainian troops inside the country, rather than in Germany. That would require putting U.S. military personnel in Ukraine, something else that Biden has prohibited until now. It raises the question of how the United States would respond if the trainers, who would likely be based near the western city of Lviv, came under attack. The Russians have periodically targeted Lviv, although it is distant from the main areas of combat.
Another hint of a shift came in recent days. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in repeating the usual administration position -- "our expectation is that they continue to use the weapons that we've provided on targets inside of Ukraine" -- seemed to suggest that there may be exceptions made for Russian aircraft operating in the safety of Russian territory, just over the border, enabling pilots to release glide bombs into eastern Ukraine.
When a reporter followed up by asking whether such aerial operations by the Russians were "off limits or not off limits," Austin did not respond.
The Russians are accustomed to such debates, and they have been unsubtle in playing to American concerns about an escalation of the war.
This week they began very public exercises with the units that would be involved in the use of tactical nuclear weapons, the kind that would be used on Ukrainian troops. Russian news reports said it was "a response to provocative statements and threats from Western officials against Russia."
But the administration appears less sensitive to such threats than it was in the early days of the war or in October 2022, when there were fears that Russia, its forces failing, might use those weapons against Ukrainian military targets. During that incident, some administration officials, picking up conversations among Russian officers, feared that there was a 50% chance a nuclear weapon could be detonated.
The current exercises, in contrast, are being dismissed as bluster and muscle-​flexing.
In a notable break from the administration's public position, Victoria Nuland, who left her position this spring as No. 3 official in the State Department, is now making a public argument that the administration needs to drop its ban on the use of its weapons against targets inside Russia.
"I think if the attacks are coming directly from over the line in Russia, that those bases ought to be fair game," she said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."
"I think it's time for that because Russia has obviously escalated this war," she said, noting that Russia's attack on Kharkiv is an effort "to decimate it without ever having to put a boot on the ground. So I think it is time to give the Ukrainians more help hitting these bases inside Russia."
Nuland was always among a far more hawkish camp inside the administration, and her view was in the minority. But over time she won more and more of the arguments over whether to send more sophisticated missiles and artillery systems to Ukraine, and each time Biden relented, the worst fears he had about escalation did not materialize.
In an interview with The New York Times this week, Zelenskyy dismissed fears of escalation, saying President Vladimir Putin of Russia had already escalated the war. And he thought it unlikely that Putin would ever make good on his threat to unleash a nuclear weapon.
Biden and some of his aides are clearly not convinced. Over the past year they have said they believe there is some red line out there that would unleash a more severe reaction from Putin. They just don't know exactly where that is, or what the reaction might be.
In private with Blinken last week and in his interview with the Times, Zelenskyy argued that at this desperate stage of the war, it is critical to let him use American weapons against Russian military units.
"This is part of our defense," he told the Times. "How can we protect ourselves from these attacks? This is the only way."

The move to recruit prisoners has drawn little criticism from the Ukrainian public, with many civilians and lawmakers saying convicts have a duty to defend their country like any other citizen.
"I believe that people who have not committed serious crimes, if they serve in special units, perhaps even on the front line, whether they dig trenches or build fortifications, why not," Pavlo Litovkin, 31, a resident of Kyiv, said in an interview last week. "We should not imitate Russia's methods of warfare, but we should manage our resources effectively."
Roman Kostenko, the chair of the defense and intelligence committee in Ukraine's parliament, said on Ukrainian television this week that the law "gives an opportunity to these people who committed crimes to go and help during the war, to prove that they can also be worthy members of society together with the boys who are now defending our country."
Russia has committed tens of thousands of convicts to the war, enlisting them in special units called "Storm Z" that have been sent on bloody assaults with little regard for casualties. That has helped Moscow gain the upper hand on the battlefield by sheer force of numbers, capturing towns and cities such as Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Marinka in the east.
It remains unclear how Ukraine's military will use its new recruits. The authorities said the prisoners would also be integrated into special units and that they would not be released until the end of the war.
But whether enough prisoners will join the army to significantly bolster its numbers and change the situation on the battlefield remains to be seen.
The court in Khmelnytsky said in a statement that a large number of prisoners "do not want to be released on parole" under the law. Maliuska said he expected many to wait and see what happened with the first wave of inmates joining the army.
They want to know "what is the quality of the training, whether the new soldiers and ex-inmates are satisfied, whether they're treated properly," Maliuska said. "That will be key."

Full text: When she first heard that Ukraine was under attack by an invading army, Halyna Semibratska, now 101 years old, was confused.
"It's not the Germans who have attacked us?" Semibratska asked. No, her daughter, Iryna Malyk, 72, replied. This time, it was their neighbor Russia.
It came as a shock.
Semibratska is one of a small group of elderly Ukrainians who have lived through not one but multiple invasions.
As children and teenagers, they saw their land and people ravaged in World War II. German troops and tanks swept through in 1941, seizing Ukraine from the Soviet Union, already seen by many Ukrainians as an occupying force. The Soviets reconquered it in 1943 and 1944.
Since February 2022, war has once again devastated some of the same towns and cities, and Russian forces are now making new inroads in the north and east. Like those in the 1940s, the invaders have set up new administrations in occupied lands, seized grain and other resources, sent in secret police, abducted community members, and instilled torture and fear.
For some Ukrainians, it has all happened within one lifetime -- childhoods revisited in old age.
At her home in the port city of Kherson, which was seized by the Russians in 2022 and liberated later that year, Zinaida Tarasenko, 83, recounted how her mother protected her from the Germans who occupied their village, Osokorivka. She was a baby, but the violence she saw still returns in her dreams.
The Germans used the family's home as a medical clinic: "My mother was pregnant. Germans forced her to clean their shoes, wash their uniform. They drank, sang songs."
When Russian forces took Kherson two years ago, it was Tarasenko's turn to protect her daughter, Olena, now 46, abducted from their home by Russian soldiers.
She searched frantically for a week, crisscrossing the city, going to a different prison each day, asking for news of her daughter. Then Olena returned. "She was afraid. I didn't ask her much. Just: 'Did they beat you?' " But, she added, "She wouldn't say much."
After Kherson was liberated in late 2022, two other women, both World War II survivors, found themselves hospitalized in beds a few feet apart and quickly became friends.
One, Halyna Nutrashenko, 94, ended up in a Kherson hospital after a Russian rocket destroyed her home, leaving her "under the rubble, inside the house," she said. "I had a house, but now I don't."
More than eight decades earlier, she witnessed the brutal Nazi occupation of her home village in the Odesa region. She remembers avoiding German soldiers; she had seen them beating children. They forced her father to labor as a metalworker.
Many others were taken away, including all of the local Jewish population. In total across Ukraine, about 1.5 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
"There were thousands of Jews in Odesa," Nutrashenko recalled. "They gathered them and shot them. Some were shot and dropped into the river. We as children were curious and went everywhere to take a look. My mother warned me all the time not to go there: 'The Germans will kill you too!' "
The life of her neighbor in the Kherson hospital, Yuliia Nikitenko, was shaped by violence even before World War II. The Soviets took her father away and executed him when she was 2 years old, during Josef Stalin's Great Purge.
"I was growing up in Velyka Oleksandrivka during the occupation," she recalled, referring to a village in the Kherson region. "The Germans evicted us. We had a small, simple house in the center. They lived there. We moved to another house close to the forest."
Eight decades later, it was Russian soldiers who came to her home. "They asked me to show my passport," said Nikitenko, now 88. "I went to find it. One opened it, looked at it and said, 'Get a Russian passport.' "
She declined. "I love Kherson and Ukraine."
She did accept money given by the Russians, as she was no longer receiving her pension. It made her feel like a traitor, she said, "but how else would I survive?"
In World War II, Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, changed hands four times in pitched battles that demolished most of the city.
Now, many buildings lie in ruins once again as shelling by Russian forces continues.
Anna Lapan, 100, a Jewish woman from Kharkiv, was 18 the first time German forces attacked the city. As the bombing began, she and her family escaped aboard a cattle train taking them east.
Her father was conscripted and killed near Stalingrad in 1943. Later that year, she returned to Kharkiv, after the Germans were pushed out for good.
Lapan was forced to flee the city again in 2022, when the Russian assault began. Her sister moved to Israel. Lapan spent three months sheltering in western Ukraine, and then returned to Kharkiv yet again.
Semibratska, too, was 18 when Nazi forces entered her hometown, Nikopol, in southern Ukraine. She remembers the date: Aug. 17, 1941.
For a time, the front line between Nazi and Soviet forces near Nikopol ran along the Dnieper River.
Today, the same stretch of river divides Ukrainian and Russian troops.
Semibratska remembered nights when German artillery fired from one bank of the Dnieper, and Soviet artillery from the opposite bank. "There was a lot of destruction."
As she spoke, Semibratska sat on her bed in an apartment she shared with her daughter in Izium in eastern Ukraine, where she moved after World War II. When Russian forces began shelling Izium in 2022, days into their invasion, Semibratska stayed in the bed, paralyzed by fear and too frail to be moved to the basement.
For the five months that Izium was under Russian occupation, they lived "without water, heating, electricity," Semibratska said.
Yahidne, north of Kyiv, was occupied in the first days of the Russian invasion. A Russian soldier there forced Hanna Skrypak, 87, and her daughter into a school basement crammed with more than 300 people.
She was held for weeks in the basement. "There was no fresh air. I didn't go out," Skrypak said.
Ten people died in the basement under the school during the weeks of Russian occupation in 2022, including another woman who survived World War II.
That left Skrypak as the oldest resident of Yahidne, the last one with living memory of both wars.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- With his army struggling to fend off fierce Russian advances all across the front, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the United States and Europe to do more to defend his nation, dismissing fears of nuclear escalation and proposing that NATO planes shoot down Russian missiles in Ukrainian airspace.
Zelenskyy said he also had appealed to senior U.S. officials to allow Ukraine to fire American missiles and other weaponry at military targets inside Russia -- a tactic the United States continues to oppose. The inability to do so, he insisted, gave Russia a "huge advantage" in cross-border warfare that it is exploiting with assaults in Ukraine's northeast.
His comments, made in an interview Monday with The New York Times in central Kyiv, were among his most full-throated appeals yet to the United States and its NATO allies for more help. Over 50 minutes at the ornate House With Chimeras in the presidential offices, he spoke with a mix of frustration and bewilderment at the West's reluctance to take bolder steps to ensure that Ukraine prevails.
Zelenskyy has long lobbied the West, for more weapons in particular. But his pleas this week come at a critical time for Ukraine's war effort, with its army in retreat and a new package of U.S. arms yet to arrive in sufficient quantities. Not since the early days of the war has Ukraine faced as grave a military challenge, analysts say.
It's also a pivotal time in Ukrainian politics. Zelenskyy spoke on the last day of his five-year presidential term. Elections scheduled for March were suspended because of the war, and he will remain president under martial law powers, with his tenure potentially stretching as long as the war.
In the wide-ranging interview, Zelenskyy, 46, discussed the wrenching sadness of visiting mass graves and consoling the families of dead soldiers, but also his own personal journey, and the "recharge" he gets from the little time he has to spend with his children.
He was most animated as he ticked off a checklist of actions he believed his allies should take to support Ukraine. He argued that NATO should shoot down Russian missiles in flight over Ukraine -- without planes crossing into Ukrainian airspace -- saying that would be a purely defensive tactic and pose no risk of direct combat with Russian forces.
"So my question is, what's the problem? Why can't we shoot them down? Is it defense? Yes. Is it an attack on Russia? No. Are you shooting down Russian planes and killing Russian pilots? No. So what's the issue with involving NATO countries in the war? There is no such issue."
"Shoot down what's in the sky over Ukraine," he added. "And give us the weapons to use against Russian forces on the borders."
That kind of direct NATO involvement, which analysts say could provoke Russia to retaliate, has been resisted in Western capitals. But Zelenskyy drew a comparison to how the United States and Britain helped Israel shoot down a barrage of drones and missiles from Iran last month.
"This is what we saw in Israel," Zelenskyy said. "Not even on such a large scale." The White House response to the comparison then was, "Different conflicts, different airspace, different threat picture."
Zelenskyy also urged the alliance to come through with more F-16 fighter jets as well as Patriot air defense systems.
"Can we get seven?" he said, saying Ukraine needed more Patriot systems but would settle for that number to protect regions key to the economy and energy sector. He suggested a decision might be reached when NATO leaders gathered for a summit in Washington in July.
"Do you think it is too much for the NATO anniversary summit in Washington?" he asked.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Struggling to contain Russian advances on the battlefield, Ukraine is increasingly taking the fight to Russia beyond the front lines in an effort to disrupt its military operations and put pressure on its economy -- targeting airfields, logistics hubs and critical energy facilities with missiles and drones.
That strategy was on full display early Friday when a series of explosions struck fuel depots, oil facilities and a power station in southwestern Russia and Crimea, the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula. Just a day before, Ukrainian missiles hit an airfield in Crimea, destroying at least three jets.
Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down more than 100 Ukrainian drones Friday, a figure that would represent one of Ukraine's largest air assaults against Russia in months. A Ukrainian security official said Ukraine was behind the attack.
Although the full extent of the damage was unclear, Russian authorities reported that an electricity substation was hit in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, leading to rolling blackouts.
Just 70 miles east of Crimea, on Russia's Black Sea coast, fires broke out at several oil facilities, including in the port of Novorossiysk, which operates an important oil terminal.
Crimea, which Russia illegally seized a decade ago, and nearby Russian Black Sea ports have long been a prime target for the Ukrainian military.
Attacks there have three main objectives: reducing Russia's capacity to use Crimea as a launchpad for missile and drone attacks; disrupting supply lines that funnel fuel and ammunition to the battlefield; and degrading the Russian fleet docked in the region to ease the pressure on Ukrainian operations in the Black Sea, such as exporting grain.
Ukraine has increasingly been striking Russian oil facilities in what military analysts say is an attempt to complicate the Russian military's logistics by hitting facilities that supply fuel for its tanks, ships and planes.
Ukrainian officials also hope the strikes can undermine the Russian energy complex, which is at the core of the country's economy and war effort -- accounting for about a third of Russia's federal budget revenue -- although they do not appear to have had any serious effect yet. The attack on Novorossiysk could mark an escalation in the Ukrainian strategy.
While Ukraine had previously attacked warships in Novorossiysk, the assault Friday was the first time it had targeted the oil facilities there, said Damien Ernst, an energy expert at the University of Liège, Belgium.
Novorossiysk is a major Russian port for oil exports, with about 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil passing through each day, Ernst said. It's also the terminal for one of the world's largest pipelines, which exports most of Kazakhstan's oil, or about 1.3 million barrels a day.
But the attack may raise further concerns in the United States, where the Biden administration has urged Ukraine to stop attacking Russian oil refineries out of concern about global oil markets.
In addition, American oil companies have a stake in the terminal. Chevron, for instance, is a significant shareholder in the pipeline transporting oil from Kazakhstan.
Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, an important logistical and military hub for the Russian army, have been more frequent.
Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-backed governor of the Crimean city of Sevastopol, home to about a half-million people, said on Telegram that schools had been closed across the city as a result of the attack. He added that repairs to the substation that had been hit would take about a day and that the resulting power shortages would force the authorities to introduce rolling blackouts.
It was the third attack in two days against Sevastopol. A day before, local authorities reported Ukrainian missile attacks on the Belbek military airfield outside the city. Satellite images verified by The New York Times showed that three Russian jets had been destroyed and another had been damaged.
Ukrainian officials have long maintained that targeting Russian assets and operations in Crimea is critical to their war effort. It "is extremely important for us, because it's the way for us to reduce the number of attacks from that region," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this year.
That objective appears be even more important now that Ukrainian troops are losing ground on the battlefield.
Russia last week launched an offensive in the northeast, quickly capturing several settlements in the Kharkiv region and forcing Ukraine to rush troops to the area.
Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists Friday that Russian troops had advanced up to 6 miles from the Russian border into Ukrainian territory, but had not reached the stronger defensive lines in the region. He added that the situation in the area had stabilized.
President Vladimir Putin has suggested that the goal of the offensive is for Russia to push Ukrainian forces back from the border.
Speaking to reporters during a trip to China on Friday, he said Ukraine's regular shelling of Russian border areas, including the city of Belgorod, had forced the Russian army to "create a buffer zone" in the Kharkiv region to protect civilians.

Full text: BERLIN -- As much as $300 billion in Russian assets, frozen in the West since the invasion of Ukraine, is piling up profits and interest income by the day. Now, Europe and the United States are considering how to use those gains to aid the Ukrainian military as it wages a grueling battle against Russian forces.
There has been a debate for months about whether it would be legal or even wise to confiscate the frozen assets altogether. While the United States and Britain have favored confiscations, significant objections have come from countries such as France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and Saudi Arabia, as well as from officials including Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank.
They argue that confiscation would be a bad precedent, a violation of sovereignty and could lead to legal challenges, financial instability and retaliatory seizures of Western assets abroad.
So the idea of confiscation appears dead for now.
But proposals to seize and use the profits earned on those Russian assets -- the interest on accumulated cash stemming from the sanctions, said Euroclear, a financial services company -- are gaining considerable ground. Both the Europeans and Americans believe that those profits could be used without raising the same legal challenges or risks to the global financial system.
But they have competing ideas on how to use the funds. The Europeans would like to transfer them to Ukraine yearly or every two years. The Americans want to find a way to get more money to Ukraine more quickly.
The debate over which approach to use is intensifying in the run-up to the Group of 7 summit meeting in Italy next month, when it is hoped an agreement will be reached. Here's a closer look at the plans.
The European plan
The European Union is expected next week to formally adopt a contentious and long-hatched plan to use most of the interest gained on the Russian assets frozen in Europe to help arm Ukraine and make Russia pay for the country's reconstruction.
After months of talks, EU nations approved the policy in March. Last week, they agreed in principle that they would be willing to use 90% of the profits to buy arms for Ukraine through the European Peace Facility, an EU structure to finance military aid and its own military missions.
The remaining 10% would go to reconstruction and nonlethal purchases, to satisfy countries such as Ireland, Austria, Cyprus and Malta, which are militarily neutral.
The European proposal only targets profits made by Belgium's central securities depository Euroclear, where about $206 billion of Russian central bank assets are held.
The European Commission expects Euroclear to hand over about $3.2 billion a year that would be transferred to the bloc's funds every two years, with a first payout expected in July. That is something roughly equivalent to what Britain promises to provide Ukraine next year, but it is small compared with the $61 billion the United States recently authorized.
Euroclear has made about $5.4 billion in net profits from the Russian assets since the invasion. Profits made until February of this year will be retained by Euroclear in case of legal claims, but the European Commission has judged that Moscow has no legal right to the profits.

The American plan
With Ukraine losing ground to Russia and in need of funds to buy more ammunition and pay salaries, the Americans argue that it is preferable to get more money to Ukraine as soon as possible.
The United States holds only a small amount of Russian assets, estimated at around $5 billion. But the Americans propose giving Ukraine some $60 billion up front, and then using the profits from the Russian assets being held in Europe to pay back the debt over time.
Such a step, they argue, would send an important signal of Western commitment to both Ukraine and Russia. Their plan does not preclude the European one, but would follow it and then potentially replace it. And it could be arranged before the November election.
Daleep Singh, a U.S. security adviser and a key architect of the Western sanctions on Russia, described the idea last month in Kyiv, Ukraine.
The Biden administration wanted to make use of interest income on frozen Russian assets in order to "maximize the impact of these revenues, both current and future, for the benefit of Ukraine today," he said.
"Instead of just transferring the yearly profits from the reserves," he said, "it's conceptually possible to transfer the 10 years of profits or 30 years of profits," he said. "The present value of those profits adds up to a very large number."
Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe for the Eurasia Group, who has explored the issue extensively, said the advantage of the American plan was that it is a form of "future proofing."
That should avoid the kind of recent, deeply politicized delay to approve aid to Ukraine from Congress. It would, Rahman said, get "ahead of a possible Trump presidency and around Congress as well."
The argument
The American plan has raised objections from Brussels that it undermines European control over the assets and entails greater risks.
If interest rates drop, Europeans argue, the money earned from the Russian assets may not be enough to pay back the debt. So who would be responsible for covering the shortfall: the United States or the European Union?
Second, if the war ends in a negotiation before the bond matures, what happens if the sanctions on Russia are lifted and Russian assets are returned? Or what if they are finally confiscated to pay for Ukrainian reconstruction? In either scenario, who would be responsible?
European officials suggest that the United States should be the guarantor, while the Americans want the Europeans to take responsibility, Rahman said. Some officials suggest that the Group of 7 take responsibility and even issue the bond, but some countries may have legal objections to that plan.
Some Europeans suggest that the European Commission should issue the bond, since the assets are in Europe, and thereby have more say over how the money is spent -- predominantly on European arms manufacturers or companies, for instance. And Europe would not have to worry about a reluctant Donald Trump or Congress.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian forces Wednesday were putting up a fierce defense in Vovchansk, a village in northeastern Ukraine about 5 miles from the Russian border, engaging in what appeared to be street fighting as they tried to contain the Russian advance in the area.
In a sign of heightened concern over Ukraine's deteriorating military situation, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy canceled his participation in all international events for the coming days, including a visit Friday to Spain where he was expected to sign a bilateral security agreement.
Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement that its forces had "partially pushed the enemy" out of Vovchansk.
A few hours earlier, it had acknowledged that its troops had withdrawn from positions in two villages, including Vovchansk, allowing Russian forces to gain a foothold.
"Active fighting is ongoing," Oleksiy Kharkivskiy, the police chief in Vovchansk, said Wednesday in a video published on Facebook from the village, in which heavy gunfire could be heard in the background.
He added that Russian troops had taken positions in several streets in the village and that the situation "is extremely difficult."
Ukrainian officials and military analysts said Ukraine's position on the battlefield in recent days has seriously worsened, as the government in Kyiv tries to repel a new Russian offensive push in the northeast that is stretching its already outnumbered and outgunned forces.
Russia has timed its new offensive, which started Friday, at an opportune moment.
Ukraine is short of manpower and is struggling to recruit more soldiers. It is also running out of ammunition because of delays in Western military aid, in particular the United States' $60.8 billion package that was passed in Congress three weeks ago, after months of political wrangling.
Wrapping up a two-day visit to Kyiv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference Wednesday that the U.S. was "rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses" to the front lines.
Blinken added that the Biden administration had allocated $2 billion for Ukraine's military, much of it to be invested in the country's defense-industrial base to help Ukraine produce its own weapons over the long term.
Ukrainian officials and military analysts say Russia's army now appears to be advancing more slowly in the northeast, six days into its offensive, partly because they have reached more urbanized areas, like Vovchansk, which makes rapid progress more difficult.
Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, said on Ukrainian television Tuesday that conditions in the area under attack were moving "toward stabilization," with additional Ukrainian units being rushed in to repel Russian advances.
But he added that "the situation is quite tense and is changing very quickly."
The assessments by the Ukrainian officials and analysts appeared to be supported by open-source maps of the battlefield compiled by independent groups analyzing combat footage. Those maps showed that Russian troops had gained footholds in two settlements in the past day, a slower rate of advance than before, when they were capturing up to five settlements a day.
Russia's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that it had captured two settlements in the northeast, a claim that could not be independently confirmed and did not match what the open-source maps showed.
Russia also said it had seized the village of Robotyne in the south. The claim could also not be independently verified and Ukrainian officials denied it.
"They are only on the outskirts, our positions are still in the village," Lt. Serhii Skibchyk, the spokesperson for the 65th Brigade, said in a comment to Ukrainian Pravda. "Both Ukrainian and Russian troops have fire advantage over the village simultaneously. But the majority of the village is still our position."
Robotyne was recaptured by Ukrainian troops last summer, in one of the few gains of Ukraine's unsuccessful counteroffensive at the time. Should it fall back into Russian hands, it could deal a blow to the morale of the Ukrainian army.
Vovchansk has been heavily bombed since the start of Russia's offensive operations Friday, including with powerful guided weapons known as glide bombs that deliver hundreds of pounds of explosives in a single blast. Almost all the residents of the village, which had a prewar population of 17,000, have fled, local authorities said.
Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region's military administration, said Wednesday that nearly 8,000 civilians had been evacuated from villages and settlements in the region. These include residents of villages on the immediate outskirts of Kharkiv that have come under increasing shelling in recent days.
Most evacuees have streamed into Kharkiv, hoping the city, Ukraine's second largest after the capital, Kyiv, would provide them with more security. But Kharkiv has been the target of numerous Russian airstrikes for several weeks.
Syniehubov said Kharkiv had been targeted six times Tuesday, including with glide bombs that hit the northern part of the city, causing heavy damage to a 12-story apartment building and injuring 22 people.

Full text: KHARKIV, Ukraine -- In the past three days, Russian troops, backed up by fighter jets, artillery and lethal drones, have poured across the northeastern border and seized at least nine villages and settlements and more square miles per day than at almost any other point in the war, save the very beginning.
In some places, Ukrainian troops are retreating, and Ukrainian commanders are now blaming each other for the defeats.
Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are fleeing to Kharkiv, the nearest big city. A reception center that hummed with a sense of order and calm Saturday had transformed into a totally different scene Sunday as exhausted people shouted at each other and families with no place to go spilled out onto the grass.
As a sense of panic spreads, especially in Kharkiv, the looming questions are: How far will this go? Is it just a momentary setback for the underdog Ukrainians, or a turning point?
Military experts say the Russian advance has put Ukraine in a dangerous spot, perhaps its most vulnerable since the early phase of the war. Ukrainian troops have been complaining for months about running out of ammunition -- exacerbated by the tangles in U.S. Congress that delayed the delivery of key weapons. And Ukrainian soldiers are exhausted.
More than two years of trying to fight off a country nearly 30 times its size geographically and much bigger in population and economy has left Ukraine so depleted and desperate for fresh troops that its lawmakers are proposing to mobilize convicts, a practice that Ukraine had ridiculed Russia for doing in the first half of the war.
One Ukrainian commander took the unusual step Sunday to blast his colleagues for what he said were terrible border defenses.
"The first line of fortifications and mines just didn't exist," Denys Yaroslavsky, a reconnaissance commander, wrote on Facebook. "The enemy freely entered the gray area, across the border line, which in principle should not have been gray!"
("Gray" areas are the contested zones between the Russian and Ukrainian front lines.)
Yaroslavsky added that street fights had broken out in Vovchansk, a small town near Kharkiv, and that it was now surrounded.
"I say this because we can die and no one will hear the truth," he wrote. "Then why is it all for?!"
Kharkiv itself is safe -- at the moment. It sits 25 miles from the border. But just outside the city, people are running for their lives. The Russians are also pressing on Lyptsi, another small town even closer to Kharkiv. Residents who fled in evacuation vans Sunday said the situation in Lyptsi was not looking good.
The Russians have used previous strikes on this city as part of their rationale for taking more Ukrainian territory. Russian leaders want to push Ukrainians back from the border and carve out a buffer zone.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's security services said Tuesday that they had foiled a Russian plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other top military and political figures. Two Ukrainian colonels accused of participating in the plot have been arrested on suspicion of treason.
The Ukrainian domestic intelligence agency, the SBU, said in a statement that the plot had involved a network of agents -- including the two colonels -- that was run by Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, the main successor to the KGB. According to the SBU, the agents working at Russia's direction were tasked with identifying people close to Zelenskyy's security detail who could take him hostage and later kill him.
The agency's statement said the other top Ukrainian officials targeted in the plot included Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the SBU, and Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified.
It is not the first time that Ukraine has reported a potential assassination attempt aimed at its top leaders. Zelenskyy said in an interview with an Italian television channel this year that his security services had told him of more than 10 such efforts.
Ukraine's security services said the two colonels accused in the plot belonged to the State Security Administration, which protects top officials. They had been recruited before the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to the statement, which identified three FSB members -- Maxim Mishustin, Dmytro Perlin and Oleksiy Kornev -- as running the operation from Moscow. The two Ukrainian colonels were not named.
In a video released by the security services, a man identified as one of the colonels, his face blurred, describes details of the apparent plot that involved blocking Zelenskyy as he entered or left a building. The authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed.
As for the assassination attempt aimed at Budanov, the services said it was planned to take place before Orthodox Easter, which was celebrated Sunday. He would have been targeted in a multilayered attack involving a rocket strike, followed by a drone attack to kill people who were fleeing and then a second rocket strike, the security services said.
Russia made no immediate comment about the accusations.
Budanov's wife was poisoned late last year, according to the Ukrainian military intelligence agency, in an incident that led to widespread speculation that Russia was stepping up efforts to target Ukraine's senior leadership.
Budanov said in February that it was difficult to say if the poisoning was an attempt to murder him, but he hinted that Russia was behind it.

Full text: BERLIN -- The Russian army is gradually expanding the role of women as it seeks to balance President Vladimir Putin's promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine.
The military's stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts.
Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and $2,000 a month -- 10 times the national minimum wage -- in return for serving in front-line roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia.
Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that -- along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions -- suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts.
It's not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country. A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in Ukraine also recruits women.
"Combat experience and military specialties are not required," read an advertisement aimed at women posted in March in Russia's Tatarstan region. It offered training and a sign-up bonus equivalent to $4,000. "We have one goal -- victory!"
The Russian military's need to replenish its ranks for what it presents as a long-term war against Ukraine and its Western allies, however, has clashed with Putin's ideological struggle, which portrays Russia as a bastion of social conservatism standing up to the decadent West.
Putin has placed women at the core of this vision, portraying them as child-bearers, mothers and wives guarding the nation's social harmony.
"The most important thing for every women, no matter what profession she has chosen and what heights she has reached, is the family," Putin said in a speech March 8.
These clashing military and social priorities have resulted in contradictory policies that seek to recruit women to the military to fill a need but send conflicting signals about the roles women can assume there.
"I have gotten used to the fact that I am often looked at like a monkey -- like, 'Wow, she's in fatigues!' " said Ksenia Shkoda, a native of central Ukraine who has fought for pro-Russian forces since 2014.
Some female volunteers do not make it to Ukraine. The convicts who enlisted in late 2023 have yet to be sent to fight, the six former and current inmates said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of possible retribution.
The reason for the delay in their deployment is unknown; the Russian Defense Ministry and prison service did not respond to requests for comment.
Shkoda and six other women fighting for Russia in Ukraine said in phone interviews or in written answers to questions that local recruitment offices still routinely turned away female volunteers or sent them to reserves. This occurs even as other officials target them with advertisements to meet broader quotas, underscoring the inherent contradiction in Russia's recruitment policies.
Tatiana Dvornikova, a Russian sociologist studying prisons for women, believes the Russian army would delay sending female convicts into battle as long as it has other recruitment options.
"It would create a very unpleasant reputational risk for the Russian army," she said, because most Russians would view such a breach of social mores as a sign of desperation.
The Russian army is on the attack in Ukraine. But its incremental gains have come at high cost, requiring a constant search for recruits.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, women who wanted to fight for the Kremlin often found their way to the front through militias in the east of Ukraine, rather than regular forces. These separatist units were chronically understaffed after a decade of smaller-scale conflict against Ukraine.
"They accepted anyone -- absolutely anyone," said Anna Ilyasova, who grew up in Ukraine's Donetsk region and joined the local separatist militia days before Russia's full-scale invasion. "I couldn't even hold an automatic rifle."
After serving in combat, Ilyasova now works as a political officer in a regular Russian battalion fighting in Ukraine.
All of the interviewed female soldiers said women remained rare in their units, outside medical roles.
Russia's cautious approach to women's participation in the military differs from the more liberal policy adopted by Ukraine.
The number of women serving in Ukrainian military has risen by 40% since the invasion, reaching 43,000 in late 2023, according the country's Defense Ministry. After the invasion, the Ukrainian military abolished gender restrictions on many combat roles.
The much larger Russian military also had about 40,000 servicewomen before the war. The majority, however, have served in administrative roles.
For Russia and Ukraine, the military opportunities available to women have long fluctuated with recruitment needs.
The Russian Empire, which included most of modern Ukraine, created its first female combat units toward the end of World War I, after years of heavy losses. Decades later, the Soviet Union became the first country to call up women for combat, to compensate for the millions of casualties suffered in the first year of the Nazi invasion.
The lionization of female snipers and fighter pilots in World War II, however, masked the discrimination and sexual abuse many women faced as soldiers. The discrimination has continued into the modern era, exemplified by the way Russian women have struggled to collect the military benefits for their service in the Afghanistan War.
In Ukraine, the majority of Russian female soldiers interviewed denied facing open discrimination. But some described male peers who felt the need to protect them, echoing the country's traditional gender roles.
"My constant urge to throw myself into the thick of the battle is often halted with arguments like, 'But you're a girl!' " said Shkoda, the pro-Russian soldier. "And this drives me absolutely mad."

Full text: Russia on Monday threatened to strike British military facilities and said it would hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid sharply rising tensions over comments by senior Western officials about possibly deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.
After summoning the British ambassador to its Foreign Ministry, Moscow warned that Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with U.K.-supplied weapons could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere.
The remarks came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
The drills are a response to "provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation," the Defense Ministry said in a statement.
It was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.
"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level," Dujarric said. "All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided."
The Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.
French President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.
The Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.
"It's a new round of escalation," Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. "It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures."
Russia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador "to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London."
Sweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said the nuclear exercises "contribute to increasing instability."
"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless," Billström told Swedish news agency TT.
It wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.
The Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: "Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news."
Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.
Also, Kremlin forces kept up the bombardment of Ukraine's power grid with a nighttime Russian drone attack on towns in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy.

Full text: Russia has put Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on its wanted list, Russian state media reported Saturday, citing the interior ministry's database.
As of Saturday afternoon, both Zelenskyy and his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, featured on the ministry's list of people wanted on unspecified criminal charges. The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, was also on the list.
Russian officials did not immediately clarify the allegations against any of the men. Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet, claimed Saturday that both Zelenskyy and Poroshenko had been listed since at least late February.
In an online statement published that same day, Ukraine's foreign ministry dismissed the reports of Zelenskyy's inclusion as evidence of "the desperation of the Russian state machine and propaganda."
Russia's wanted list also includes scores of officials and lawmakers from Ukraine and NATO countries. Among them is Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of NATO and EU member Estonia, who has fiercely advocated for increased military aid to Kyiv and stronger sanctions against Moscow.
Russian officials in February said that Kallas is wanted because of Tallinn's efforts to remove Soviet-era monuments to Red Army soldiers in the Baltic nation, in a belated purge of what many consider symbols of past oppression.
Fellow NATO members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have also pulled down monuments widely seen as an unwanted legacy of the Soviet occupation of those countries.
Russia has laws criminalizing the "rehabilitation of Nazism" that include punishing the "desecration" of war memorials.
Also on Russia's list are cabinet ministers from Estonia and Lithuania, as well as the International Criminal Court prosecutor who last year prepared a warrant for President Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges. Moscow has also charged the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, with what it deems "terrorist" activities, including Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian infrastructure.
The Kremlin has repeatedly sought to link Ukraine's leaders to Nazism, even though the country has a democratically elected Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust, and despite the aim of many Ukrainians to strengthen the country's democracy, reduce corruption and move closer to the West.
Moscow named "de-​Nazification, de-militarization and a neutral status" of Ukraine as the key goals of what it insists on calling a "special military operation" against its southern neighbor.
The Holocaust, World War II and Nazism have been important tools for Putin in his bid to legitimize Russia's war in Ukraine. World War II, in which the Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people, is a linchpin of Russia's national identity, and officials bristle at any questioning of the USSR's role.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- The Ukrainian marine infantryman endured nine months of physical and psychological torture as a Russian prisoner of war, but he was allotted only three months of rest and rehabilitation before being ordered back to his unit.
The infantryman, who asked to be identified only by his call sign, Smiley, returned to duty willingly. But it was only when he underwent intensive combat training in the weeks afterward that the depth and range of his injuries, both psychological and physical, began to surface.
"I started having flashbacks, and nightmares," he said. "I would only sleep for two hours and wake up with my sleeping bag soaking wet." He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for psychological care. He's still receiving treatment.
Ukraine is just beginning to understand the lasting effects of the traumas its prisoners of war experienced in Russian captivity, but it has been failing to treat them properly and returning them to duty too early, say former prisoners, officials and psychologists familiar with individual cases.
Nearly 3,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been released from Russia in prisoner exchanges since the 2022 invasion began. More than 10,000 remain in Russian custody, some of whom have endured two years of conditions that a United Nations expert described as horrific.
The Ukrainian government's rehabilitation program, which has usually involved two months in a sanitarium and a month at home, is inadequate, critics say, and the traumas suffered by Ukrainian prisoners are growing with the length and severity of the abuse they are being subjected to as the war drags on.
Russia's torture of prisoners of war has been well documented by the United Nations, with former inmates speaking of relentless beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence and mock executions, so much so that one expert described it as a systematic, state-endorsed policy. Many detainees have also reported lingering symptoms such as blackouts and fainting spells stemming from repeated blows to the head that were severe enough to cause concussions.
Ukraine's prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said in September that "about 90% of Ukrainian prisoners of war have been subjected to torture, rape, threats of sexual violence or other forms of ill-treatment."
The Russian military did not answer a request for comment on the allegations of mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war.
Ukrainian prosecutors have identified 3,000 former military and civilian prisoners who can serve as witnesses for a case they are building for the Ukrainian courts to charge Russian individuals and officials with mistreatment of prisoners. The prosecutors encouraged two of the former prisoners to speak to The New York Times.
One of them was Smiley, 22, who was captured at the beginning of the war when the Russian navy seized Ukrainian positions on Snake Island in the Black Sea. He spoke a year after his release, saying he hoped that shedding light on the conditions of Russian prisons would help not only his own rehabilitation, but also the thousands of prisoners of war still in captivity.
"My sister persuaded me to give my first interview," he said. " 'You need to tell,' she said. Maybe if we speak, it will help the treatment of our guys."
A second Ukrainian serviceman made available by the prosecutors gave a lengthy interview but declined to give his name or call sign, because of the stigma surrounding the abuses he suffered.
The serviceman, 36, said he was taken prisoner along with several thousand soldiers and marines after a long siege at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol in May 2022. He spent nine months in Russian captivity before being released in a prisoner exchange in early 2023.
He spent most of his time in three detention facilities in the Russian towns of Taganrog, Kamensk-Shakhtinsky and Kursk. He returned critically underweight and suffering from an injured spine and, like many others, blackouts, dizziness and ringing in the ears from frequent beatings on the head.
"I am not fainting any longer," the serviceman said, "but I have difficulties with my back and concussion, and a squeezing all the time of the area around my heart."
Despite his injuries, he was ordered to return to light duty as a guard after only two months of rest in a sanitarium.
Smiley said much of the violence was of a sexual nature. One prison unit repeatedly struck the prisoners all over their bodies, including on the genitals, with batons that gave electric shocks, he said. On another occasion, he said, a cellmate was repeatedly kicked in the genitals during roll call, where the prisoners were lined up with their legs spread, facing a wall in a corridor. Smiley suffered permanent injury from an untreated broken pelvis from a truncheon blow and could not bend or lie down without assistance for two weeks.
The second serviceman said he was forced to strip and place his genitals on a stool as his interrogators hit them with a ruler and lay a knife on them, threatening to castrate him.
Interrogators put him through a mock execution, firing a volley of gunfire beside him while he was blindfolded. They threatened him with rape, the serviceman said, making him choose what they should use -- a mop handle or the leg of a chair.
He said he was never actually penetrated, but others were raped.
"After that you cannot walk normally," he said. "You suffer for weeks. Other guys had the same treatment."
"I think they had such an order to break us psychologically and physically so that we would not want anything else in life," he said, adding that there were suicides in the Taganrog jail.
"You could hear the screams all day," the serviceman said. "Impossible screams." Sometimes during a lull, the prisoners could hear the voices of children playing outside, he said.
The ordeal for the former prisoners is by no means over once back home.
"The most difficult thing is having too many people around," the serviceman said. "Everyone is peacefully walking in the park and you are still afraid that someone is listening, or that you might get shoved or say the wrong thing."

Full text: Ukraine's top military commander has issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have "worsened significantly in recent days."
Russian forces were pushing hard to exploit their growing advantage in manpower and ammunition to break through Ukrainian lines, the commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said in a statement over the weekend.
"Despite significant losses, the enemy is increasing his efforts by using new units on armored vehicles, thanks to which he periodically achieves tactical gains," the general said.
At the same time, Ukraine's Energy Ministry told millions of civilians to charge their power banks, get their generators out of storage and "be ready for any scenario" as Ukrainian power plants are damaged or destroyed in devastating Russian airstrikes.
With few critical military supplies flowing into Ukraine from the U.S., commanders are being forced to make difficult choices over where to deploy limited resources as the toll on civilians grows daily.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a controversial law Tuesday, days after it was passed by parliament, potentially helping Kyiv to boost conscription to replenish depleted forces to fend off Russia's continued aggression, The Associated Press reported.
The mobilization law is expected to take effect in a month and make it easier to identify every draft-eligible man in the country. Many have dodged conscription by avoiding contact with authorities. The law also provides soldiers with incentives, such as cash bonuses or money toward buying a house or car, which Ukraine can't afford, according to analysts.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's military chief warned Saturday that the battlefield situation in the industrial east has "significantly worsened in recent days," as warming weather allowed Russian forces to launch a fresh push along several stretches of the 620-mile front line.
In an update on the Telegram messaging app, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyy said Moscow had "significantly" ramped up its assaults since President Vladimir Putin extended his nearly quarter-century rule in a preordained election last month that saw anti-war candidates barred from the ballot and independent voices silenced in a Kremlin-backed media blockade.
According to Syrskyy, Russian forces have been "actively attacking" Ukrainian positions in three areas of the eastern Donetsk region, near the cities of Lyman, Bakhmut and Pokrovsk, and beginning to launch tank assaults as drier, warmer spring weather has made it easier for heavy vehicles to move across previously muddy terrain.
"Despite significant losses, the enemy is intensifying its efforts by using new units (equipped with) armored vehicles, thanks to which it periodically achieves tactical success," Syrskyy said.
On Saturday, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed the capture of a village that had been the site of fierce fighting for close to 18 months. Analysts from Ukraine's nongovernmental Deep State group, which tracks frontline developments, had reported on Russia's takeover of Pervomaiske, about 28 miles southeast of Pokrovsk, in the early hours of Thursday.
The group said in a Telegram update Saturday that Moscow's forces had also taken Bohdanivka, another eastern village close to Bakhmut, where the war's bloodiest battle raged for nine months until it fell to Russia last May. Ukraine's Defense Ministry shortly afterward denied that Bohdanivka had been captured, saying "intense fighting" continued there.
With the war in Ukraine entering its third year and a vital U.S. aid package for Kyiv stuck in Congress, Russian troops are ramping up pressure on exhausted Ukrainian forces on the front line to prepare to grab more land this spring and summer.
Russia has relied on its edge in firepower and personnel to step up attacks across eastern Ukraine. It has increasingly used satellite-guided gliding bombs -- which allow planes to drop them from a safe distance -- to pummel Ukrainian forces beset by a shortage of troops and ammunition.
Also Saturday, Germany announced that it will deliver an additional Patriot air defense system to Ukraine, days after Russian missiles and drones struck infrastructure and power facilities Thursday across several regions, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes without power, in what private energy operator DTEK described as one of the most powerful attacks this year. The German Defense Ministry said it would "begin the handover" of the Patriot system immediately, without providing a precise timeline.
In an update on X, formerly Twitter, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he had discussed the "massive" Russian air attacks on civilian energy infrastructure with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and declared that Berlin will "stand unbreakably by Ukraine's side."
Putin described the strikes as retribution for Ukrainian attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure; a slew of Ukrainian drone strikes over the past few months has hit oil refineries deep inside Russia.
Moscow renewed its assault on Ukrainian energy facilities last month.
The volume and accuracy of recent attacks have alarmed the country's defenders, who say Kremlin forces now have better intelligence and fresh tactics in their campaign to annihilate Ukraine's electrical grid and bring its economy to a halt.

Full text: Viktor Savvinov had already been imprisoned several times for various crimes -- including robbery, auto theft and assault -- when he murdered a female drinking companion during a quarrel in 2020, stabbing her in the chest with four knives.
A court in Russia's Siberian region of Yakutia sentenced him to 11 years in a maximum-security prison. So when recruiters from the private Wagner mercenary group offered him freedom and a clean slate if he deployed to fight in Ukraine, Savvinov, a morgue orderly, seized the opportunity.
By February, Savvinov had completed his service and was back in his native village of Kutana. That month, on Defenders of the Fatherland Day, he was, residents said, staggering drunk around the snowy streets, complaining loudly that villagers showed him insufficient respect as a veteran. The next night, he killed two of them, according to a law enforcement report, striking a male drinking buddy dead with a metal crowbar before killing his estranged aunt, who lived next door, by axing her in the head and then torching her wooden house.
Russia's practice of recruiting convicts has been the backbone of its success in Ukraine, providing an overwhelming manpower advantage in the war. But it is backfiring in tragic ways as inmates pardoned for serving in Ukraine return to Russia and commit new crimes.
Overall numbers on recidivist crimes are hard to establish because the Russian government restricts the release of any public information that puts the war in a bad light. A survey of Russian court records by independent media outlet Verstka found that at least 190 criminal cases were initiated against pardoned Wagner Group recruits in 2023. That included 20 cases of murder or attempted murder as well as rape, robbery and drug-related crimes, among others.
Still, the Kremlin appears to be doubling down on the policy of recruiting inmates. On March 23, President Vladimir Putin signed a new law to formalize the process.
Before, the criteria for pardons were opaque, and Putin pardoned convicts who had fought in Ukraine by signing decrees that were never made public. The new law established a long list of eligible crimes that were explicitly added into Russia's criminal code, including murder, robbery and some rapes. Earning pardons is now a matter of law, not presidential decree, but convicts let out of prison to fight can get one only after their military commanders approve.
Crimes not eligible include terrorism, espionage or treason, and some sex crimes involving minors.
"Nobody used to lock their doors in the village at night, but now they lock them with a key, even during the day," said a resident of Kutana, a Siberian village of 1,000 people, declining in an interview to use her name out of fear that Savvinov might win another pardon if he were convicted and volunteered again to fight in Ukraine.
"Normal life" was gone, she said, noting that the aunt he killed had once been named a "teacher of the year" and awarded a prize from the Kremlin.
Similar experiences have scarred other cities and towns.
In Chita, near the border with Mongolia, a Ukraine veteran was sentenced last month to 14 years in prison for strangling a 22-year-old prostitute to death with his bare hands. In 2020, he was sentenced to 14 years for strangling and dismembering an 18-year-old girl.
In the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a former Wagner mercenary who had served 15 years on theft and fraud charges was sentenced in February to 17 years for raping two schoolgirls, ages 10 and 12.
Near the southwestern city of Krasnodar last spring, a young father, Kirill Chubko, owner of a party business, and one of his employees stopped to fix a burst tire on a darkened road one night. They encountered three highway robbers who forced them to withdraw around $2,000 from their banks before fatally stabbing them, according to a law enforcement report. The head of the gang had been sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2016 for preying on motorists but was released to serve in Ukraine.
In 2017, Sergey Rudenko was sentenced to 10 years in prison for strangling his girlfriend to death with a belt. He earned his release when he signed on with Wagner to fight in Ukraine.
In April 2023, in Rostov-on-Don in southwestern Russia, Rudenko, 34, went looking for an apartment. After arguing with the real estate agent over the rent, he strangled her with a cloth cord, then stabbed her in the neck, a law enforcement report said. A district court sentenced Rudenko to more than 11 years in prison.
Local news reports did not identify the victim, and several residents, reached by telephone, said they knew nothing about it.
The details of these crimes were drawn from numerous interviews, local investigation reports, local news articles and court records. Most relatives and friends of the murder victims spoke on the condition of anonymity, concerned that the killers might win new pardons and come after them. Those interviewed were also worried that the authorities might charge them under wartime laws against denigrating the military, which includes publicizing soldiers' previous crimes.
The Wagner Group began recruiting convicts in August 2022, with a promise of presidential pardons in exchange for signing a six-month contract. Before being disbanded last year in the wake of a failed mutiny against the Kremlin, the group said it had recruited more than 50,000 prisoners.
Many of those men died, some are still fighting and an estimated 15,000 ex-convicts have returned home, according to Olga Romanova, head of Russia Behind Bars, a nongovernmental organization dealing with prisoner issues.
"A great many prisoners were back on the loose, and it became a big problem," she said. The crimes seemed to belie the official narrative that the war is being fought to make Russia safer and that veterans will constitute a new elite, she added.
Crimes committed by veterans, whether from the Wagner Group or otherwise, often go unreported. National media outlets have mentioned only a few sensational cases. "It is a story about invisible violence," said Kirill Titaev, a Russian sociologist working at Yale University who specializes in criminology. "It is a big problem for the society, but one they do not recognize."

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has signed into law three measures aimed at replenishing the ranks of his country's exhausted and battered army, including the politically poisonous step of lowering the age when men become eligible for mobilization, and eliminating some medical exemptions.
Parliament passed the legislation lowering the draft eligibility age to 25, from 27, last May, but Zelenskyy had delayed signing it in hopes that it would not be needed. He relented Tuesday and signed the measure, along with laws eliminating a category of medical exemption known as "partially eligible" and creating an electronic database of men in Ukraine, starting at age 17, to crack down on draft dodgers.
"It is a very unpopular decision, and that is why Zelenskyy held it without signing," said Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker in parliament who is in the opposition European Solidarity party. "Now he has no choice."
Russia's forces have been on the offensive along the front line, and Ukrainian generals
have warned of a broader attack in the spring or summer, even as Ukraine's army runs low on ammunition and many soldiers have been on continual combat duty for two years.
Ukraine's army of about 1 million soldiers is fighting the largest war in Europe since World War II, waged in muddy trenches or the ruins of cities. Casualty rates are high. Most men who wanted to volunteer for the military have already done so, and small anti-draft protests had broken out before the new laws were passed.
Ukraine is expected, at best, to hold the existing front lines in ground fighting this year, but only if a new influx of American weapons arrives, military analysts say, and risks falling back without it. To maximize its efforts, Ukraine plans to replenish its army through mobilization while trying to keep Russia off balance with sabotage missions behind enemy lines and long-range drone strikes, such as attacks on an oil refinery and weapons plant in Russia on Tuesday.
Ukraine relies on its allies for most new ammunition and weapons, and renewing that arsenal is mostly a matter beyond the country's control. In Washington on Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., laid out conditions for a vote on a fresh infusion of American weapons and financial aid, in the strongest indication yet that the assistance could be forthcoming despite opposition from many Republicans.
On Wednesday, NATO's top diplomat said the alliance was poised to take more control over military support sent to Ukraine -- a role that the United States has played for the past two years.
Details are still being worked out, but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed to pursue plans to give the military alliance more oversight in coordinating security assistance and training for Ukraine.
Should the plan comes to fruition, it would represent a shift from NATO's previous reluctance to be pulled more directly into the conflict and risk a severe military response from President Vladimir Putin of Russia. And it is not certain that NATO's most powerful member, the United States, ultimately will agree to a measure that could dilute its influence.
At home, Ukraine has stumbled on the overhaul of mobilization rules.
In January, its parliament withdrew a draft law on mobilization that included stiffened penalties for draft dodgers. That bill was reintroduced in February, but bogged down in parliament as lawmakers submitted more than 4,000 amendments. It would further expand the draft by closing loopholes for men obtaining a second college degree or in instances when several men in a family sought exemptions to care for a disabled relative. A vote is expected this month.
It is unclear how quickly Ukraine will draft and train the additional troops, or whether they will be ready before the expected Russian offensive. The comprehensive mobilization bill that has yet to pass in parliament envisions three months of training for soldiers drafted during wartime.
"The decision is taken -- it's a good one, but it's too late," said Serhiy Hrabsky, a colonel and a commentator on the war for the Ukrainian news media.
And lowering the draft age alone will not resolve Ukraine's looming need for soldiers. In December, Zelenskyy said the military had asked to mobilize 450,000 to 500,000 soldiers. Ukraine's military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said last week that the army had "significantly reduced" its request, without specifying a number.
Zelenskyy has said he does not intend to conscript women into the military, although women with medical educations are required to register for the draft.
Ukraine's total population of 25- and 26-year-olds was about 467,000 in 2022, the latest year when the government published population estimates, according to Natalia Tilikina, the director of Institute of Youth, a research group. But many are already serving in the military, living in occupied areas or outside Ukraine, or have jobs or disabilities that exempt them from conscription.
As in most former Soviet states, Ukraine has a small generation of 20-year-olds, because birthrates plummeted during the deep economic depression of the 1990s. Because of this demographic trough, the country has three times as many men in their 40s as in their 20s.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's military had only one Bohdana howitzer in its arsenal when Russia invaded the country two years ago. Yet that single weapon, built in Ukraine in 2018 and able to shoot NATO-caliber rounds, proved so effective in the earliest days of the war that it was trucked to battlefields across the country, from the northeastern city of Kharkiv to the southwestern coast along the Black Sea and points in between.
Now Ukraine's arms industry is building eight of the self-propelled Bohdana artillery systems each month, and although officials will not say how many they've made in all, the increased output signals a potential boom in the country's weapons production.
The ramp-up comes at a pivotal moment.
Russia's war machine is already quadrupling weapons production in round-the-clock operations. Ukraine's forces are losing territory in some key areas, including the strategic eastern town of Avdiivka, which they withdrew from in February. A U.S. aid package is still hung up in Congress. And while European defense firms are gingerly opening operations in Ukraine, major American weapons producers have yet to commit to setting up shop in the middle of a war.
It is widely agreed that Ukraine needs to rebuild its domestic defense industry so that its military will not have to rely for years to come on the West, which has at times hesitated to send sophisticated weapons systems -- including air defenses, tanks and long-range missiles. Whether that can be done in time to alter the trajectory of a war remains to be seen.
But Ukraine's military engineers have already shown surprising skill in jury-rigging older weapons systems with more modern firepower. And over the last year alone, Ukraine's defense companies have built three times as many armored vehicles as they were making before the war and have quadrupled production of anti-tank missiles, according to Ukrainian government documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Funding for research and development is forecast to increase eightfold this year -- to $1.3 billion from $162 million -- according to an analysis of Ukraine's military budget through 2030 by Janes, a defense intelligence firm. Military procurement jumped to a projected 20-year high of nearly $10 billion in 2023, compared with a prewar figure of about $1 billion a year.
"We say that death to the enemy starts with us," Alexander Kamyshin, Ukraine's Strategic Industries minister, said last month.
"It's about showing that we don't sit and wait until you come help us," Kamyshin said. "It's about trying to make things ourselves."
Some weapons are proving harder to produce in Ukraine than others. They include 155 mm artillery shells, which are in dire need on the battlefield but depend on imported raw materials and licensing rights from Western manufacturers or governments.
Kamyshin said domestic production of 155 mm shells was "on the way," but would not say when.
Once a main supplier of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's defense industry shrank over three decades of budget cuts after the country declared independence in 1991. The government in Kyiv now plans to spend about $6 billion this year on weapons made in Ukraine, including 1 million drones, but, Kamyshin said, "we can produce more than we've got funds available."
The long period of decline may be hard to overcome.
To restart production of the 2S22 Bohdana howitzer, for example, officials had to track down the weapon's original designers and engineers, some of whom had been assigned to menial military tasks across Ukraine.
By June 2022, Ukrainian forces were using the Bohdana's 30-mile range to target and destroy Russian air defenses in the successful battle for Snake Island in the Black Sea.
"It was a very big surprise for the Russians," said Maj. Myroslav Hai, a special operations officer who helped liberate the island. "They couldn't understand how somebody could use artillery for this distance."
In Europe, political leaders who worry about eroding American support and business executives who see new market opportunities are promoting military production ventures in Ukraine, even if it may be several years before any of those weapons or materiel reach the battlefield.
German arms giant Rheinmetall and Turkish drone maker Baykar are building manufacturing plants in Ukraine.
France's defense minister said in March that three French companies that produce drones and land warfare equipment were nearing similar agreements.
Last month, Germany and France announced a joint venture through defense conglomerate KNDS to make parts for tanks and howitzers in Ukraine and, eventually, whole weapons systems.
Experts said Ukraine's military has positioned air defense systems around some of its most critical weapons factories. It's likely that foreign-backed plants will largely be built in the country's west, far from the front lines but also protected by air defenses.
To date, Ukrainian and U.S. officials said, no major American weapons manufacturer has announced plans to start production in Ukraine. However, some senior executives have visited Kyiv in recent weeks to meet with Kamyshin and other officials, and the Biden administration hosted meetings in December to bring together Ukrainian leaders and U.S. military contractors.
Helping Ukraine rebuild its defense industry has become even more vital as Republicans in Congress have blocked $60 billion in military and financial aid to Ukraine.
However, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., recently signaled that he is looking for politically palatable ways to bring the aid package to a vote.
But a web of bureaucracy in Kyiv threatens to slow at least some investors as they seek to push proposals through three ministries: Defense, Digital Transformation and Kamyshin's Strategic Industries.
"We're trying to get a sense of how this all fit together, and how they work together," said William Taylor, a former ambassador to Kyiv who is leading an effort by the U.S. Institute of Peace to help link up American and Ukrainian defense firms.
"American firms have got a lot of opportunities to invest in other places around the world," Taylor said. "This is one where U.S. national interests are at stake, so it's why we would take an extra step to help make these connections."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has begun publicly laying out potential conditions for extending a fresh round of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, the strongest indication yet that he plans to push through the chamber a package that many Republicans view as toxic and have tried to block.
His terms may include tying the aid for Ukraine to a measure that would force President Joe Biden to reverse a moratorium on liquefied natural gas exports, something that Republicans would see as a political victory against the Democratic president's climate agenda. The move would also hand Johnson a powerful parochial win, unblocking a proposed export terminal in his home state of Louisiana that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles.
"When we return after this work period, we'll be moving a product, but it's going to have some important innovations," Johnson said Sunday in an interview on Fox News.
That strongly suggests that the aid package for Ukraine, which has been stalled on Capitol Hill for months amid Republican resistance, could clear Congress within weeks. It enjoys strong support among Democrats and a large coalition of mainstream Republicans, and the main obstacle standing in its way in the House has been
Johnson's refusal to bring it up in the face of vehement hard-right opposition in the GOP to sending more aid to Ukraine.
But after the Senate passed a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine and Israel, and with Johnson facing pressure from the Biden administration and NATO allies, the speaker has been searching for a path forward that would provoke the least political backlash in his own ranks.
Now, the question appears to be not whether Johnson will allow aid to come to the floor, but in what form and when.
In the interview, he openly discussed how to structure the aid, saying he had not come to any final decisions on what he would ultimately put to a vote but that he had been "working to build that consensus" among House Republicans.
Johnson cited the REPO Act, which would pay for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen, as one idea under consideration.
"If we can use the seized assets of Russian oligarchs to allow the Ukrainians to fight them, that's just pure poetry," he said.
U.S. officials had previously been skeptical of the idea, warning that there was no precedent for seizing large sums of money from another sovereign nation and that the move could set off unpredictable legal ramifications and economic consequences. Only about $5 billion or so of Russian assets are in the hands of U.S. institutions; more than $300 billion in Russian central bank assets are stashed in Western nations.
But the Biden administration has quietly come around on the idea amid waning financial support for Ukraine.
Johnson also floated the idea of sending some of the aid as a loan, noting that "even President Trump has talked about" the concept.
And he mentioned an idea he first privately raised in February, at a White House meeting with Biden and other congressional leaders, of tying the aid to lifting the Biden administration's pause on liquefied natural gas exports. He and other Republicans have argued that by prohibiting U.S. exports of domestic energy, the administration has in effect increased reliance on Russian gas and indirectly funded President Vladimir Putin's offensive against Ukraine. He cited the case of Calcasieu Pass 2, the proposed export terminal in Louisiana.
"We want to unleash American energy," Johnson said. "We want to have natural gas exports that will help unfund Vladimir Putin's war effort there."
Taken together, the measures Johnson outlined appear to be aimed at convincing skeptical Republicans that at the very least, the cost of the aid package would be offset. Though he did not mention it Sunday, he has also considered advancing fresh sanctions against Russia.
The reversal of the liquefied natural gas moratorium in particular could be a powerful political incentive for Republicans, ratcheting up pressure on the White House to abandon a policy they have long denounced.
The administration paused new export permits after months of protests by environmental activists, who argued that adding new gas export facilities would lock in decades of additional greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change. The administration said it would take time to analyze the effect of new permits on the climate, national security and the economy.
Johnson's search for a politically viable option to funding Ukraine's attempts to fend off Russian attacks puts him in the middle of two powerful and opposing forces. The hard-right flank of his party, egged on by former President Donald Trump, has urged him not to allow a vote on aid for Ukraine, arguing that the United States should not be pouring tens of billions of dollars into another country's war. But the leaders of most NATO countries have warned Johnson that a failure to extend help to Ukraine could lead to the young democracy's undoing, a message that has been echoed by mainstream Republicans, Biden and Democrats.
Johnson and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine spoke by phone Thursday, and Zelenskyy briefed the speaker on the dire battlefield situation and urged "quick passage" of aid.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- A Russian cruise missile strike on infrastructure in Ukraine's western Lviv region killed a man, while another died in a northeast attack, officials said Sunday.
The attack in Lviv destroyed a building and sparked a fire, Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on social media app Telegram.
In the Kharkiv region, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said an air attack killed a 19-year-old man after a missile hit a gas station.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands in Ukraine's Odesa region were left without power Sunday after debris from a downed Russian drone caused a blaze at an energy facility, Gov. Oleh Kiper said. Some 170,000 homes suffered power outages as a result, said Ukraine's largest private electricity operator, DTEK.
The Ukrainian air force said it shot down nine of the 11 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, as well as nine out of 14 cruise missiles.
Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent days, causing significant damage in several regions.
In a message Sunday to mark the date when some of Ukraine's Christians celebrate Easter, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the country to persevere.
"There is not a day or night right now when Russian terror does not try to shatter our lives," he said.
"Our spirit does not give up and knows that death can be averted. Life can win," the president added.
In Russia, meanwhile, 10 Czech-made Vampire rockets landed in the region of Belgorod on Sunday, the Ministry of Defense said. One woman was injured when a fire broke out following the attack, said regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Another woman was killed as shelling hit villages along the Russian border.

Full text: A day before the U.S. Embassy in Moscow put out a rare public alert this month about a possible extremist attack at a Russian concert venue, the local CIA station delivered a private warning to Russian officials that included at least one additional detail: The plot in question involved an offshoot of the Islamic State group.
U.S. intelligence had been tracking the group and believed the threat credible.
But within days, President Vladimir Putin was disparaging the warnings, calling them "outright blackmail" and attempts to "intimidate and destabilize our society."
Three days after he spoke, gunmen stormed Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow on the night of March 22 and killed at least 144 people in the deadliest attack in Russia in nearly two decades. The Islamic State quickly claimed responsibility for the massacre with statements, a photo and a propaganda video.
What made the security lapse seemingly even more notable was that in the days before the massacre, Russia's own security establishment had also acknowledged the domestic threat posed by the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, called Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K.
Internal Russian intelligence reporting that most likely circulated at the highest levels of the government warned of the increased likelihood of an attack in Russia by ethnic Tajiks radicalized by the Islamic State Khorasan, according to information obtained by the Dossier Center, a London research organization, and reviewed by The New York Times.
Russia has identified the four men suspected of carrying out the attack as being from Tajikistan.
Now, Putin and his lieutenants are pointing fingers at Ukraine, trying to deflect attention from a question that would be front and center in any nation with an independent media and open debate in its politics: How did Russia's vast intelligence and law enforcement apparatus, despite significant warnings, fail to head off one of the biggest terrorist attacks in the country in Putin's nearly quarter century in power?
The full picture is still unclear, and U.S. and European officials, as well as security and counterterrorism experts, emphasize that even in the best of circumstances, with highly specific information and well-oiled security services, disrupting covert international terror plots is difficult.
But they say the failure most likely resulted from a combination of factors, paramount among them the deep levels of distrust, both within the Russian security establishment and in its relations with other global intelligence agencies.
They also point to the way Putin has hijacked his domestic security apparatus for an ever-widening political crackdown at home -- as well as his focus on crusading against Ukraine and the West -- as distractions that probably did not help.
This account of the Russian failure to prevent the concert attack is based on interviews with U.S. and European security officials, security experts and analysts specializing in international intelligence capabilities. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence details.
"The problem is to actually be able to prevent terrorist attacks, you need to have a really good and efficient system of intelligence sharing and intelligence gathering," said Andrei Soldatov, an expert on Russian intelligence, who underscored that trust is needed inside the home agency and with agencies of other countries, as is good coordination.
He said, "That's where you have problems."
'Fictitious threats'
Putin's definition of what constitutes an extremist began to expand even before his invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.
The agency primarily responsible for combating terrorism in Russia is called the Second Service, a branch of the Federal Security Service, or the FSB. It once focused on Islamic extremists, bands of assassins and homegrown neo-Nazi groups.
But as Putin has advanced his political crackdown at home, its list of targets ballooned to include opposition figures like Alexei Navalny, who died last month in a Russian prison, and his supporters, as well as LGBTQ+ rights activists, Jehovah's Witnesses, peace activists and other Kremlin critics.
The number of Islamic-related organizations on the register of extremist organizations listed by Russian Federal Service for Financial Monitoring has declined since 2013. At the same time, hundreds of organizations have been added related to Jehovah's Witnesses, which has its worldwide headquarters in the United States and is viewed with suspicion by the FSB.
Russia is one of the chief military backers of the Islamic State's opponents in the Middle East, including Syria's Bashar Assad, making Russian interests a key target of the Islamic extremist group. But as one European security official put it, the Russians were pursuing "fictitious threats" rather than real ones.
Still, U.S. and European officials say the Russian officials tracking Islamic extremists have their own unit within the Second Service that has remained robustly staffed and funded, despite the strains on the security services from the domestic political crackdown and the war against Ukraine.
The failure to prevent the attack was probably the result of a combination of other factors, including fatigue after being "especially alert" during the period before Russia's recent presidential election, said a European security official, who tracks the activities of the Russian intelligence services.
There is also evidence that Russian authorities did respond to the warnings this month, at least initially.
Increased security
On March 7, the day after the CIA station issued the private warning to the Russians, the FSB announced that it had killed two Kazakhs southwest of Moscow, while disrupting an Islamic State Khorasan plot to target a synagogue in the capital. U.S. officials thought the raid was possibly a sign that Russian authorities were springing into action.
Iosif Prigozhin, a well-known Russian music producer, recalled that he and his wife, Russian pop star Valeriya, who performed at Crocus City Hall this month, noticed the increase in security at the venue in early March; guards checked people's bags and cosmetics cases and took other measures he hadn't seen there before, he said.
"I even called the general director and said, 'Listen, what's going on? Are you expecting high-ranking guests?' " Prigozhin said in an interview. "He said, 'Iosif, I'll tell you later.' He didn't say anything over the phone. He said it's necessary -- and that's it."
Around the same time, the venue's staff was warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack and instructed on what to do in such an event, said Islam Khalilov, 15, a student who was working in the coat check on the night of the attack, in an interview posted on YouTube.
One of Putin's favorite singers, Grigory Leps, was performing there March 8. Shaman, a singer whose pro-Kremlin jingoism has catapulted him to popularity amid wartime fervor, was scheduled to take the stage a day later.
But the heightened security didn't ferret out one of the attackers, Shamsidin Fariduni.
Employees at the music hall, speaking to Russian media, recalled seeing Fariduni at the concert venue March 7. A photo of him in a light brown coat at the venue, verified by the Times, has circulated in the Russian media.
Alexander Bortnikov, the director of the FSB, emphasized last week in public comments that the information the United States provided was "of a general nature."
"We reacted to this information, of course, and took appropriate measures," he said, noting that the actions the FSB took to follow up on the tip didn't confirm it.
The adversarial relationship between Washington and Moscow prevented U.S. officials from sharing any information about the plot beyond what was necessary, out of fear Russian authorities might learn their intelligence sources or methods.
In its March 7 public warning, the U.S. Embassy said the risk of a concert venue attack in Moscow was acute for the next 48 hours. U.S. officials say it's possible Russian authorities pushed hard around the 48-hour warning period but later grew more relaxed and distrustful when an attack didn't occur.
By then, the skepticism about the plot had grown within the Russian government, and Putin felt comfortable deriding the public warnings in a speech to top officers at the FSB, using the occasion to attack the West again.
"Because the FSB -- and Putin -- sees the world through the prism that the United States is out to get Russia, any information that is not consistent with that frame is easily dismissed," said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, who previously led analyses of Russia by the U.S. intelligence community.
She said, "That dynamic may have resulted in an intelligence failure with devastating consequences."
A 'duty to warn'
When it informed Russia privately about the potential terror plot, the CIA was adhering to 2015 guidance known as "duty to warn" directives, requiring the intelligence establishment to inform "U.S. and non-U.S. persons" of specific threats aimed at "intentional killing, serious bodily injury and kidnapping."
These directives are relatively rare, but the United States is obliged to issue them, even to adversaries, and has done so with both the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Iranian government in the past year. The warnings aren't usually made public unless U.S. authorities think the threat could affect American citizens, which was the case in Moscow.
Putin, in both 2017 and 2019, thanked the U.S. government for providing information that had helped Russia foil terrorist attacks in St. Petersburg. But analysts say a similar gesture would be impossible in the acrimonious environment he has created since invading Ukraine.
The United States has been tracking Islamic State Khorasan activities closely in recent months, senior officials said. In the course of the monitoring, which has involved electronic intercepts, human informants and other means, American operatives picked up fairly specific information about plotting in Moscow, officials said.
Experts said Russia's intelligence services have traditionally been focused on domestic terrorist threats emanating from separatist and religious extremist groups in Russia's North Caucasus region. Large terrorist attacks on Russian soil attributed to international groups like the Islamic State group or al-Qaida have been rare, and the country's domestic security services have less experience tracking those threats and are less skilled at penetrating Central Asian extremist cells.
In the days since the attack, Moscow has returned the favor to Washington for offering the tip by claiming its warning should be treated as evidence of possible American complicity.
Bortnikov, the FSB director, said Tuesday that Islamic extremists alone couldn't possibly have carried out the attack. He blamed, among others, the United States.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Moscow launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure Friday, with a mass barrage of 99 drones and missiles hitting regions across the country, Ukraine's armed forces said.
Air raid warnings rang out across the nation, with 10 Ukrainian regions coming under fire, the country's interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said.
Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine in recent days, launching several missile barrages on the capital, Kyiv, and hitting energy infrastructure across the country in apparent retaliation for recent Ukrainian aerial attacks on the Russian border region of Belgorod. Such sporadic attacks, however, have been common throughout the war.
Large-scale blackouts have already affected Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, where 700,000 people lost power after the city's thermal power plant was hit in a drone and missile attack March 22.
In the winter of 2022-23, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing frequent blackouts. Many in Ukraine and the West expected that Russia might repeat that strategy this winter, but Russia instead initially focused its strikes on Ukraine's defense industries.
Ukraine's state-owned grid operator, Ukrenergo, said Friday's attack targeted thermal and hydroelectric power plants across central and western regions.
In a statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine's Kaniv and Dniester hydroelectric power stations had come under attack and accused Moscow of risking an ecological disaster similar to the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023.
Both Kyiv and Moscow have accused the other of destroying the dam, but the various Russian allegations -- that it was hit by a missile or taken down by explosives -- fail to account for a blast so strong that it registered on seismic monitors in the region.
The dam's destruction led to deadly flooding, endangered crops, threatened drinking water supplies for thousands and unleashed an environmental catastrophe.
Zelenskyy also warned that other countries would be threatened if the dams were hit. Dnister Hydroelectric station, located near the city of Novodnistrovsk, Ukraine, is about 9 miles from the border with Moldova.
"The water will not stop in front of the border," Zelenskyy said.
DTEK, Ukraine's largest private electricity operator, also said that three of its thermal power plants had been damaged in the attacks. It announced emergency power shutdowns in the city of Odesa, leaving several neighborhoods without power.
Five people, including a 5-year-old girl, were wounded during the attack in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, said local Gov. Serhii Lysak.
He later said that another man had been killed and one more injured in a separate drone attack Friday.

Full text: A day before the U.S. Embassy in Moscow put out a rare public alert this month about a possible extremist attack at a Russian concert venue, the local CIA station delivered a private warning to Russian officials that included at least one additional detail: The plot in question involved an offshoot of the Islamic State group.
U.S. intelligence had been tracking the group and believed the threat credible.
But within days, President Vladimir Putin was disparaging the warnings, calling them "outright blackmail" and attempts to "intimidate and destabilize our society."
Three days after he spoke, gunmen stormed Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow on the night of March 22 and killed at least 144 people in the deadliest attack in Russia in nearly two decades. The Islamic State quickly claimed responsibility for the massacre with statements, a photo and a propaganda video.
What made the security lapse seemingly even more notable was that in the days before the massacre, Russia's own security establishment had also acknowledged the domestic threat posed by the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, called Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K.
Internal Russian intelligence reporting that most likely circulated at the highest levels of the government warned of the increased likelihood of an attack in Russia by ethnic Tajiks radicalized by the Islamic State Khorasan, according to information obtained by the Dossier Center, a London research organization, and reviewed by The New York Times.
Russia has identified the four men suspected of carrying out the attack as being from Tajikistan.
Now, Putin and his lieutenants are pointing fingers at Ukraine, trying to deflect attention from a question that would be front and center in any nation with an independent media and open debate in its politics: How did Russia's vast intelligence and law enforcement apparatus, despite significant warnings, fail to head off one of the biggest terrorist attacks in the country in Putin's nearly quarter century in power?
The full picture is still unclear, and U.S. and European officials, as well as security and counterterrorism experts, emphasize that even in the best of circumstances, with highly specific information and well-oiled security services, disrupting covert international terror plots is difficult.
But they say the failure most likely resulted from a combination of factors, paramount among them the deep levels of distrust, both within the Russian security establishment and in its relations with other global intelligence agencies.
They also point to the way Putin has hijacked his domestic security apparatus for an ever-widening political crackdown at home -- as well as his focus on crusading against Ukraine and the West -- as distractions that probably did not help.
This account of the Russian failure to prevent the concert attack is based on interviews with U.S. and European security officials, security experts and analysts specializing in international intelligence capabilities. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence details.
"The problem is to actually be able to prevent terrorist attacks, you need to have a really good and efficient system of intelligence sharing and intelligence gathering," said Andrei Soldatov, an expert on Russian intelligence, who underscored that trust is needed inside the home agency and with agencies of other countries, as is good coordination.
He said, "That's where you have problems."
'Fictitious threats'
Putin's definition of what constitutes an extremist began to expand even before his invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.
The agency primarily responsible for combating terrorism in Russia is called the Second Service, a branch of the Federal Security Service, or the FSB. It once focused on Islamic extremists, bands of assassins and homegrown neo-Nazi groups.
But as Putin has advanced his political crackdown at home, its list of targets ballooned to include opposition figures like Alexei Navalny, who died last month in a Russian prison, and his supporters, as well as LGBTQ+ rights activists, Jehovah's Witnesses, peace activists and other Kremlin critics.
The number of Islamic-related organizations on the register of extremist organizations listed by Russian Federal Service for Financial Monitoring has declined since 2013. At the same time, hundreds of organizations have been added related to Jehovah's Witnesses, which has its worldwide headquarters in the United States and is viewed with suspicion by the FSB.
Russia is one of the chief military backers of the Islamic State's opponents in the Middle East, including Syria's Bashar Assad, making Russian interests a key target of the Islamic extremist group. But as one European security official put it, the Russians were pursuing "fictitious threats" rather than real ones.
Still, U.S. and European officials say the Russian officials tracking Islamic extremists have their own unit within the Second Service that has remained robustly staffed and funded, despite the strains on the security services from the domestic political crackdown and the war against Ukraine.
The failure to prevent the attack was probably the result of a combination of other factors, including fatigue after being "especially alert" during the period before Russia's recent presidential election, said a European security official, who tracks the activities of the Russian intelligence services.
There is also evidence that Russian authorities did respond to the warnings this month, at least initially.
Increased security
On March 7, the day after the CIA station issued the private warning to the Russians, the FSB announced that it had killed two Kazakhs southwest of Moscow, while disrupting an Islamic State Khorasan plot to target a synagogue in the capital. U.S. officials thought the raid was possibly a sign that Russian authorities were springing into action.
Iosif Prigozhin, a well-known Russian music producer, recalled that he and his wife, Russian pop star Valeriya, who performed at Crocus City Hall this month, noticed the increase in security at the venue in early March; guards checked people's bags and cosmetics cases and took other measures he hadn't seen there before, he said.
"I even called the general director and said, 'Listen, what's going on? Are you expecting high-ranking guests?' " Prigozhin said in an interview. "He said, 'Iosif, I'll tell you later.' He didn't say anything over the phone. He said it's necessary -- and that's it."
Around the same time, the venue's staff was warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack and instructed on what to do in such an event, said Islam Khalilov, 15, a student who was working in the coat check on the night of the attack, in an interview posted on YouTube.
One of Putin's favorite singers, Grigory Leps, was performing there March 8. Shaman, a singer whose pro-Kremlin jingoism has catapulted him to popularity amid wartime fervor, was scheduled to take the stage a day later.
But the heightened security didn't ferret out one of the attackers, Shamsidin Fariduni.
Employees at the music hall, speaking to Russian media, recalled seeing Fariduni at the concert venue March 7. A photo of him in a light brown coat at the venue, verified by the Times, has circulated in the Russian media.
Alexander Bortnikov, the director of the FSB, emphasized last week in public comments that the information the United States provided was "of a general nature."
"We reacted to this information, of course, and took appropriate measures," he said, noting that the actions the FSB took to follow up on the tip didn't confirm it.
The adversarial relationship between Washington and Moscow prevented U.S. officials from sharing any information about the plot beyond what was necessary, out of fear Russian authorities might learn their intelligence sources or methods.
In its March 7 public warning, the U.S. Embassy said the risk of a concert venue attack in Moscow was acute for the next 48 hours. U.S. officials say it's possible Russian authorities pushed hard around the 48-hour warning period but later grew more relaxed and distrustful when an attack didn't occur.
By then, the skepticism about the plot had grown within the Russian government, and Putin felt comfortable deriding the public warnings in a speech to top officers at the FSB, using the occasion to attack the West again.
"Because the FSB -- and Putin -- sees the world through the prism that the United States is out to get Russia, any information that is not consistent with that frame is easily dismissed," said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, who previously led analyses of Russia by the U.S. intelligence community.
She said, "That dynamic may have resulted in an intelligence failure with devastating consequences."
A 'duty to warn'
When it informed Russia privately about the potential terror plot, the CIA was adhering to 2015 guidance known as "duty to warn" directives, requiring the intelligence establishment to inform "U.S. and non-U.S. persons" of specific threats aimed at "intentional killing, serious bodily injury and kidnapping."
These directives are relatively rare, but the United States is obliged to issue them, even to adversaries, and has done so with both the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Iranian government in the past year. The warnings aren't usually made public unless U.S. authorities think the threat could affect American citizens, which was the case in Moscow.
Putin, in both 2017 and 2019, thanked the U.S. government for providing information that had helped Russia foil terrorist attacks in St. Petersburg. But analysts say a similar gesture would be impossible in the acrimonious environment he has created since invading Ukraine.
The United States has been tracking Islamic State Khorasan activities closely in recent months, senior officials said. In the course of the monitoring, which has involved electronic intercepts, human informants and other means, American operatives picked up fairly specific information about plotting in Moscow, officials said.
Experts said Russia's intelligence services have traditionally been focused on domestic terrorist threats emanating from separatist and religious extremist groups in Russia's North Caucasus region. Large terrorist attacks on Russian soil attributed to international groups like the Islamic State group or al-Qaida have been rare, and the country's domestic security services have less experience tracking those threats and are less skilled at penetrating Central Asian extremist cells.
In the days since the attack, Moscow has returned the favor to Washington for offering the tip by claiming its warning should be treated as evidence of possible American complicity.
Bortnikov, the FSB director, said Tuesday that Islamic extremists alone couldn't possibly have carried out the attack. He blamed, among others, the United States.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Moscow launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure Friday, with a mass barrage of 99 drones and missiles hitting regions across the country, Ukraine's armed forces said.
Air raid warnings rang out across the nation, with 10 Ukrainian regions coming under fire, the country's interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said.
Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine in recent days, launching several missile barrages on the capital, Kyiv, and hitting energy infrastructure across the country in apparent retaliation for recent Ukrainian aerial attacks on the Russian border region of Belgorod. Such sporadic attacks, however, have been common throughout the war.
Large-scale blackouts have already affected Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, where 700,000 people lost power after the city's thermal power plant was hit in a drone and missile attack March 22.
In the winter of 2022-23, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing frequent blackouts. Many in Ukraine and the West expected that Russia might repeat that strategy this winter, but Russia instead initially focused its strikes on Ukraine's defense industries.
Ukraine's state-owned grid operator, Ukrenergo, said Friday's attack targeted thermal and hydroelectric power plants across central and western regions.
In a statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine's Kaniv and Dniester hydroelectric power stations had come under attack and accused Moscow of risking an ecological disaster similar to the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023.
Both Kyiv and Moscow have accused the other of destroying the dam, but the various Russian allegations -- that it was hit by a missile or taken down by explosives -- fail to account for a blast so strong that it registered on seismic monitors in the region.
The dam's destruction led to deadly flooding, endangered crops, threatened drinking water supplies for thousands and unleashed an environmental catastrophe.
Zelenskyy also warned that other countries would be threatened if the dams were hit. Dnister Hydroelectric station, located near the city of Novodnistrovsk, Ukraine, is about 9 miles from the border with Moldova.
"The water will not stop in front of the border," Zelenskyy said.
DTEK, Ukraine's largest private electricity operator, also said that three of its thermal power plants had been damaged in the attacks. It announced emergency power shutdowns in the city of Odesa, leaving several neighborhoods without power.
Five people, including a 5-year-old girl, were wounded during the attack in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, said local Gov. Serhii Lysak.
He later said that another man had been killed and one more injured in a separate drone attack Friday.

Full text: A continued stalemate led by congressional Republicans over U.S. aid to Ukraine in fighting its war with Russia fails to take into account that freedom around the world is at stake, the French ambassador to the U.S. said Monday.
Ambassador Laurent Bili, making his first visit to Chicago since being appointed to the post more than a year ago, also said Russia President Vladimir Putin's efforts to blame Ukraine for a deadly Islamic State attack at a concert venue outside Moscow coincides with a stepped up Russian disinformation campaign being waged in France.
French President Emanuel Macron on Sunday elevated that nation's security alert status to its highest level in the wake of the attack that killed at least 137 people on Friday and said his country had foiled two attempted attacks. The Islamic State, or ISIS, claimed credit for the attack and U.S. officials have tied the attack to the Islamic State in Khorasan, an ISIS affiliate operating in central Asia, and had provided warnings to Russia.
"When all the evidence is pointing out (ISIS) in a very obvious direction, that idea to try to put the blame on Ukraine doesn't make much sense," Bili said of Putin's insistence with no proof that Ukraine is to blame. "But we know all the propaganda machine work. And we have also been seeing this last month that Russia has really been beefing up its disinformation attacks in France."
France, with a "tradition of freedom and willingness to live together" has been targeted by terrorist attacks for many years. Bili said.
"We know that we are a target and have been beefing up for years with preparation, especially with the situation with the Olympics, the situation with Gaza," he said of the Summer Olympics in Paris in July as well as unrest over Israel's war with Hamas.
"ISIS in Khorasan is also one of the movements that is rising up. We are stepping up cooperation and we enjoy a great degree of cooperation with the intelligence community in the U.S," he said.
Macron has been hawkish in wanting to see Russia prosecuted for its invasion and war with Ukraine. And Bili said that lost in the discussion over Republican efforts to block U.S. aid to Ukraine is that "Europeans are spending much more than the U.S." in assistance and have significantly increased contributions to NATO.
"I think it's important to realize what is at stake. For me, I grew up with that memory about the legacy of the Greatest Generation, that we have been living in peace for 75 years," he said of the World War II generation of Americans who liberated an occupied France from Nazi Germany.
"Russia is breaking the rule based on international order," he said, "and if we don't face that challenge, we will pay in Europe or elsewhere."

Full text: Russian voters formed long lines outside polling stations in major cities during the presidential election Sunday with many saying they were heeding a call by opposition leaders to protest a rubber-stamp process that is certain to keep Vladimir Putin in power.
Before he died last month, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny called on supporters to go to the polls at midday Sunday, the last day of the three-day vote, to express dissatisfaction with Putin, set to win his fifth presidential term in a vote that lacks real competition.
Navalny's team, which is continuing his work, and other opposition movements reiterated calls for the protest in the weeks leading up to the vote. Simply appearing at the polling station, for an initiative known as Noon Against Putin, they said, was the only safe way to express discontent in a country that has drastically escalated repression since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago.
The opposition leaders said showing solidarity with like-minded citizens by mere presence was more important than what the voters chose to do with their ballots because the election lacked real choice.
"This is our protest -- we don't have any other options," said Lena, 61, who came to a polling station in central Moscow before noon with the intention of spoiling her ballot. "All of us decent people are hostages here."
Like other voters interviewed, she declined to provide her last name, for fear of reprisal. Alissa, 25, said she came because she is against the war.
"It is so important to see people who think like you, who don't agree with what is happening," she said.
Noon Against Putin, initially proposed by an exiled former regional Russian lawmaker, became a rallying call for Russia's embattled opposition after the death of Navalny in an Arctic prison.
His widow and political heir, Yulia Navalnaya, has presented the initiative as a way to honor his legacy and protest his death, which she blamed on the government.
"You saw each other. The world has seen you," Leonid Volkov, one of Navalny's chief aides, wrote in a note on social media thanking supporters who came out at midday. "Russia is not Putin. Russia is you."
Volkov hosted a live broadcast of the vote on Navalny's YouTube channel earlier Sunday and wore a sling on his arm. He was taken to the hospital last week after being beaten with a hammer outside his home in Lithuania, a reminder of the dangers faced by the opposition, even in exile.
The nature of the midday initiative makes it virtually impossible to estimate just how many of the people who came to the polls at that time came with the intent of registering a protest.
But around 11:30 a.m. Moscow time, the street outside the polling station on Brodnikov Lane, just south of the city's famed Tretyakov Gallery, was relatively empty. Suddenly, at noon, a long line formed.
More broadly, the muted, purely symbolic form of civil disobedience envisioned by the initiative underscores just how little the Russian opposition can do to influence events in the country amid pervasive repression.
The government has vowed to punish attempts to disrupt the vote. A Russian human rights and legal aid group, OVD-Info, said more than 70 had been detained across Russia on Sunday for actions related to elections.
Despite the risks, all five voters consulted by The New York Times outside one polling station in Moscow said they came to express their support for Navalny.
"According to the Russian Constitution, the source of power is the Russian people," said one voter, Kristina, 22, as the noon bells of a nearby church sounded. "We are supposed to be the ones with power here, but unfortunately in our country, the person in power is a murderer. He killed our Lyosha," she said, using a nickname for Navalny, for whom she had once worked as a volunteer.
Kristina later sent a photograph of a ballot she said she had spoiled before depositing it in the ballot box. It had the words "Navalny, we're with you," written in capital letters across the candidate choices. Shortly after that, she was briefly detained by authorities, who she said had asked her why she "spent so long" standing near the polling station.
Long lines were also seen at Russian embassies in countries with large Russian diasporas. Noon Against Putin was expected to be large-scale abroad because dissident voters faced lower risks outside Russia.
Navalnaya was seen standing in a long line Sunday afternoon outside the Russian Embassy in Berlin.
Ukraine launched a new wave of attacks Sunday inside Russian territory, killing at least two people, according to local officials. Authorities also said a drone fell on a refinery in the Krasnodar region, sparking a blaze that was extinguished a few hours later.
Drone attacks reported in the Yaroslavl region, about 500 miles from the Ukraine border, were some of the farthest launched by Ukraine so far.
A drone strike Sunday at a military installation in Moldova's breakaway republic of Transnistria destroyed a helicopter and ignited a fire, officials said. The area's pro-Russia authorities blamed the strike on Ukraine.

Full text: Aside from falsely insisting that he did not lose the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump has peddled a related set of theories centered on one question: What would the world have looked like had he stayed in office?
Trump, in rallies and interviews, has repeatedly asserted -- more than a dozen times since December, by one rough count -- that three distinct events, in the United States and abroad, are a product of the 2020 election.
"There wouldn't have been an attack on Israel. There wouldn't have been an attack on Ukraine. And we wouldn't have had any inflation," he declared during a rally in January in Las Vegas. The next month in South Carolina, he baselessly claimed that Democrats had admitted as much.
Politicians routinely entertain what-ifs, which are impossible to prove or rebut with certainty. But Trump's suppositions underscore the ways in which he often airs questionable claims without explanation and which might not be supported by the broader context.
Here's a closer look at his assertions.
War in Ukraine
"I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled before I even take office. Got to be settled. It never would have happened. And even the Democrats admit that if Trump were president, that would have -- Putin would have listened to me 100%," Trump said during a January rally in New Hampshire.
Trump's notion that he could have simply dissuaded President Vladimir Putin of Russia from invading Ukraine is not necessarily borne out by history.
The conditions precipitating the decision by Putin to invade Ukraine in February 2022 date back many years. Putin has maintained that Ukraine is fundamentally part of Russia, ignoring evidence to the contrary -- including the views of most Ukrainians. And he has long taken issue with the expansion of NATO, including the addition of former Soviet republics, as well as the prospect of Ukraine one day joining.
Asked to elaborate on Trump's argument, his campaign simply referred to a 2022 poll in which 62% of respondents answered "no" when asked whether they believed that Putin would move against Ukraine if Trump were president.
Still, experts do not see a realistic scenario in which Trump would have stopped Putin from advancing on Ukraine.
"There was no appreciable shift in Russian policy because Trump was making nice to Putin," said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Israel-Hamas war
"The horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn't even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office," Trump said during a rally this month in Virginia.
There is no clear Trump-era policy that would have prevented Hamas from carrying out its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, experts say. His campaign did not elaborate on his theory, and apart from his effort to blame his successor, he has said very little about the conflict.
At best, Trump can contend that there was a sense of calm in the Middle East during his presidency, but that argument has its flaws.
"What we can say that might support Trump's claim is that we did not see significant conflict between Israel and Hamas during his time in office," said Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an organization that has been critical of Hamas. He added that the unpredictability of Trump's foreign policy could have theoretically worked to deter adversaries in the Middle East from stoking conflict.
But, Schanzer said, that calm was deceiving: Hamas built up its military infrastructure during that time.
Others are more adamant that Trump's argument lacks merit.
"In the case of the Hamas attack, there is nothing that his administration could or would have done differently from the Biden administration," said Natan Sachs, the director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.
He noted that the Trump administration facilitated the Abraham Accords, under which Israel normalized relations with several Arab countries. "But the downside of the Abraham Accords was also the marginalization of the Palestinian issue," Sachs said.
Inflation
"When you think of it, inflation wouldn't have happened," Trump said at a rally this month in Georgia.
Trump's claim ignores the reality that the coronavirus pandemic undoubtedly helped drive up prices -- meaning inflation was all but inevitable regardless of who won the 2020 election -- and he has not explained in detail how he would have averted inflation. The surge began in early 2021 and peaked in mid-2022.
"The pandemic of 2020-2022 caused massive disruption to supply chains around the world and made it harder to produce and ship goods for an extended period of time," said Tarek Hassan, an economics professor at Boston University. "This led to what we call cost-push inflation in all major economies, with the prices of goods jumping up as a result. Neither the outgoing President Trump in 2020 nor President Biden had much influence on this outcome."
But analysts have attributed many factors to the uptick, including government policies. Research indicates that pandemic relief packages signed by Trump and Biden played a role by driving up consumption.
Three notable developments before January 2021 helped drive inflation, said Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University.
In 2020, as the pandemic took root, the Federal Reserve began buying mortgage bonds and government debt in large quantities -- or what is known as quantitative easing. Its balance sheet that year jumped to more than $7 trillion in assets from $4 trillion. At the same time, lawmakers and Trump were spending trillions to respond to COVID and its economic effects, causing the federal deficit to spike. And housing costs and rents began to rise. (The median price of homes sold nationally jumped 14.6% from the second quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021.)
"You put that together, and it is challenging to make the case that there would be no inflation," Harvey said. "But again, we just don't know the counterfactual."
Trump has suggested that, if elected this year, he would lower inflation, although economists say some of his proposals -- including tariffs on imported goods and his calls for enormous deportations -- could potentially have the opposite effect.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- A Russian missile attack on Odesa killed at least 17 people and injured 73 others, Ukrainian authorities said Friday, the latest in a series of air assaults on the southern port city.
Ukraine's state emergency services said a first missile hit several houses late in the morning, prompting rescuers to rush to the scene. A second missile then landed on the same site, causing many fatalities, including at least one paramedic and a rescue worker. The reports could not be independently verified.
Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, posted photos on social media showing rescue workers evacuating one of their colleagues on a stretcher and trying to put out a fire near a destroyed building. A photo released by the Odesa City Council showed what appeared to be a rescuer lying on the grass, his lifeless body covered by a foil blanket.
Ukrainian authorities said the attacks destroyed a three-story building, damaged 10 houses and a gas pipeline, and started a fire that spread to an area of about 1,300 square feet.
It was the third deadly assault on Odesa in two weeks, with a total of at least 34 people killed. It came as Russians began voting in a presidential election that President Vladimir Putin was all but certain to win, and while his country's war in Ukraine had entered its third year and showed no sign of abating.
On the same day, Russian authorities said Ukrainian shelling of the western city of Belgorod, close to Ukraine, had killed one civilian and wounded two others. Their claims could not be independently verified.
The Belgorod region has been the scene of cross-border ground attacks by Ukraine-backed Russian groups this week, apparently aimed at disrupting Putin's reelection campaign messaging that the war had turned in Russia's favor. Russian forces have had the advantage on the battlefield in recent months, attacking simultaneously in several places all along the front line.
Friday's assault on Odesa appeared to be what military officials call a "double-tap attack," hitting the same target twice with a time gap between the two strikes in order to kill emergency workers or firefighters responding to the first strike.
Russian forces have used this tactic before in Ukraine and Syria.
Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army in the south, said the attack had involved ballistic missiles fired from Crimea, the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula.
Odesa, a lifeline for the Ukrainian economy, is home to a vast port infrastructure vital to Ukraine's Black Sea exports.
The city, which Putin has long claimed belongs to Russia, was relatively untouched by the fighting at the start of the war. But over the past six months, Russia has targeted grain silos and naval infrastructure there.

Full text: Ukrainian shelling of the Russian city of Belgorod killed two people, officials said Saturday, while Russia claimed to have thwarted a new attempt by saboteurs to cross the border.
Saturday's attacks occurred as Russians entered the second day of voting in a presidential election that is all but certain to extend Vladimir Putin's rule by another six years after he crushed dissent.
A man and a woman died in the attack and three other people were wounded, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.
It was the latest in exchanges of long-range missile and rocket fire in Russia's war on Ukraine.
Five people were also wounded when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in the village of Glotovo, a little over a mile from the Ukrainian border, Gladkov said.
Russia's Defense Ministry also said Saturday that it had thwarted attempts by "Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups" to enter the country from Ukraine's Sumy region. That followed an armed incursion claimed by Ukraine-based Russian opponents of the Kremlin on Tuesday in the Belgorod and Kursk regions.
Russia's Defense Ministry said that Moscow's military and security forces killed 30 fighters while thwarting the latest incursion.
The Freedom of Russia Legion, one of the groups who claimed to have crossed the border Tuesday, warned of a "massive strike" on military bases in Belgorod late Saturday afternoon and urged residents to take shelter.
Shortly afterward, Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed that Russian air defenses had shot down 15 rockets over the Belgorod region.
Cross-border attacks in the area have occurred sporadically since the war began and have been the subject of claims and counterclaims, as well as disinformation and propaganda.
Brazil's Bolsonaro: Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Saturday that he was "not afraid of any trial," a day after documents released by the Supreme Court revealed that two top military leaders said the populist plotted to remain in power after losing the 2022 election.
Speaking at a campaign event in Rio de Janeiro's mayoral race, Bolsonaro avoided commenting on the content of any of several investigations targeting him, but claimed he was a victim of "persecution" for causing trouble for the country's political left. Authorities in February confiscated Bolsonaro's passport.
The court documents included testimony from Bolsonaro's former army and air force commanders that includes the first direct mentions of the right-wing leader as actively participating in a conspiracy to ignore the results of the October 2022 election won by his rival, current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Nigeria violence: At least 16 soldiers, including four officers, were killed in southern Nigeria while responding to a distress call during fighting between two communities, defense officials said Saturday.
The attack in the oil-rich, riverine Delta state happened in the Bomadi council area Thursday when the soldiers, deployed to keep the peace, "were surrounded by some community youths and killed," Defense Headquarters spokesman Brig. Gen. Tukur Gusau said in a statement.
The attack led to the death of the commanding officer, two majors, one captain and 12 soldiers, Gusau said, adding that a few arrests had been made related to the attack.
Local media reported the conflict in Delta was related to a lingering land dispute between the Okuama and Okoloba communities, which resulted in the abduction of one man. The soldiers had unsuccessfully tried to negotiate his freedom.
Pakistan bombing: A suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden truck into a sprawling military post in northwest Pakistan on Saturday, the military and security officials said. At least seven soldiers were killed in the bombing and ensuing shootout.
Troops responding to the attack in North Waziristan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan, killed six more attackers, the military said.
A newly formed militant group, Jaish-e-Fursan-e-Muhammad, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement.
North Waziristan long served as a base for the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups until the army claimed a few years back that it had cleared the region of insurgents.
Wales politics: Vaughan Gething won the Welsh Labour Party leadership contest Saturday, and is set to become the first Black leader of Wales' semi-autonomous government.
Gething, the son of a Welsh father and a Zambian mother, will be the first Black leader of a government in the U.K. -- and, according to him, of any European country.
Gething, who is currently Welsh economy minister, narrowly beat Education Minister Jeremy Miles in a race to replace First Minister Mark Drakeford. Gething, 50, won 51.7% of the votes cast by members of the party and affiliated trade unions, and Miles 48.3%.
Automated vehicle crash: The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating a fatal crash in San Antonio, Texas, involving a Ford electric vehicle that may have been using a partially automated driving system.
The agency said in a statement Friday that a team of investigators from its Office of Highway Safety will travel to Texas and work with police on the Feb. 24 crash on Interstate 10.
The NTSB said that preliminary information shows a Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV equipped with the company's partially automated driving system struck the rear of a Honda CR-V stopped in one of the highway lanes. The driver of the CR-V was killed.
"NTSB is investigating this fatal crash due to its continued interest in advanced driver assistance systems and how vehicle operators interact with these technologies," the agency statement said.
Filmmaking climber dies: David Breashears, a mountaineer, author and filmmaker who co-directed and co-produced a 1998 IMAX documentary about climbing Mount Everest, has died, his business manager confirmed Saturday. He was 68.
Breashears was found Thursday unresponsive at his home in Marblehead, Massachusetts, Ellen Golbranson said. She said he died of natural causes, but "the exact cause of death remains unknown at this time."
Breashears summited Mount Everest five times, including with the IMAX camera in 1996, his family said.
"He combined his passion for climbing and photography to become one of the world's most admired adventure filmmakers," the family said in a statement.

A photo released by the Odesa City Council showed what appeared to be a rescuer lying on the grass, his lifeless body covered by a foil blanket.
Ukrainian authorities said the attacks destroyed a three-story building, damaged 10 houses and a gas pipeline, and started a fire that spread to an area of about 1,300 square feet.
It was the third deadly assault on Odesa in two weeks, with a total of at least 34 people killed. It came as Russians began voting in a presidential election that President Vladimir Putin was all but certain to win, and while his country's war in Ukraine had entered its third year and showed no sign of abating.
On the same day, Russian authorities said Ukrainian shelling of the western city of Belgorod, close to Ukraine, had killed one civilian and wounded two others. Their claims could not be independently verified.
The Belgorod region has been the scene of cross-border ground attacks by Ukraine-backed Russian groups this week, apparently aimed at disrupting Putin's reelection campaign messaging that the war had turned in Russia's favor. Russian forces have had the advantage on the battlefield in recent months, attacking simultaneously in several places all along the front line.
Friday's assault on Odesa appeared to be what military officials call a "double-tap attack," hitting the same target twice with a time gap between the two strikes in order to kill emergency workers or firefighters responding to the first strike.
Russian forces have used this tactic before in Ukraine and Syria.
Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army in the south, said the attack had involved ballistic missiles fired from Crimea, the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula.
Odesa, a lifeline for the Ukrainian economy, is home to a vast port infrastructure vital to Ukraine's Black Sea exports.
The city, which Putin has long claimed belongs to Russia, was relatively untouched by the fighting at the start of the war. But over the past six months, Russia has targeted grain silos and naval infrastructure there.

Full text: Ukraine fired at least eight missiles at Russia's Belgorod border region, killing two people and wounding 12, officials said Thursday, as Kyiv's forces apparently kept up efforts to rattle the Kremlin on the eve of Russia's presidential election.
Also, Ukrainian forces attempted cross-border raids that were repelled in Belgorod and the Kursk region, local authorities said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops killed 195 Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed five tanks and four armored infantry vehicles, two days after saying it killed 234 Ukrainian troops in another border assault.
It is not possible to independently verify the Russian claims. Cross-border attacks in the area have occurred sporadically since the war began and have been the subject of claims and counterclaims.
The Ukrainian assaults on Russian territory in recent days, including long-range drone attacks and alleged incursions by Ukraine-based Russian proxies, have come as Russian President Vladimir Putin heads for near-certain reelection.
Putin has sought to persuade Russians to keep him in power against a backdrop of what he says are foreign threats to the country. In a video released Thursday, he called on Russians to go to the polls, calling participation in the election a "manifestation of patriotic feeling."
Since coming to power almost 25 years ago, Putin has eliminated nearly all independent media and opposition voices in Russia, particularly after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine that initially went badly wrong.
Analysts say the Kremlin is worried about low turnout during the three days of voting.
Orbán warning: Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is jeopardizing Hungary's position as a trusted NATO ally, the U.S. ambassador to Budapest warned Thursday, with "its close and expanding relationship with Russia," and with "dangerously unhinged anti-American messaging" in state-controlled media.
The ambassador, David Pressman, has for months criticized Orbán for effectively siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, but his latest remarks sharply ratcheted up tensions and indicated that trust in Hungary among NATO allies had collapsed.
Hungary is "an ally that behaves unlike any other" and is "alone on the defining issue of European security of the last quarter-century, Russia's war in Ukraine," Pressman said in a speech in Budapest marking the 25th anniversary of Hungary's admission to the Western military alliance.
Orbán, a darling of MAGA Republicans in the United States, visited Donald Trump last week at the former president's home and members-only club in Florida. After their meeting, Orbán claimed in an interview with Hungarian state television that Trump had outlined to him a "pretty detailed plan" for ending the war in Ukraine that would involve an abrupt halt to United States aid to Russia's embattled neighbor.
Such a plan closely parallels what Orbán has been advocating for the European Union -- a suspension of all financial and military support for Ukraine and a policy of pushing the government in Kyiv into immediate peace negotiations with Moscow.
Transition in Haiti: A plan to create a transitional presidential council is moving forward after a majority of Haitian parties and coalitions submitted the names of those charged with finding new leaders for the country, Caribbean officials said Thursday.
The names were provided to a regional trade bloc known as Caricom that is helping lead the transition.
"It is all up now to the Haitians, as they are the ones who want a Haitian-led solution," Surinamese Foreign Minister Albert Ramdin said. "It is for them to pick up the ball and run with it, being responsible for their own destiny."
Caribbean leaders had announced plans to create the council after meeting behind closed doors Monday in Jamaica with officials including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Shortly after the meeting, Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged to resign once the council is created.
The council will be responsible for choosing an interim prime minister and a council of ministers, as well as help organize general elections, which haven't been held in nearly a decade.
Indonesia election: The camps of the two Indonesian presidential candidates who appear to have lost an election last month announced plans Thursday to challenge the official results in the Constitutional Court with allegations of widespread fraud.
Indonesians voted Feb. 14 for a successor to popular President Joko Widodo, who is serving his second and final term. The election is a three-way race among Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto and two former provincial governors, Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo.
The General Election Commission had officially tallied over 78% of the votes as of Thursday, with Subianto taking 58.82%, Baswedan 24.50% and Pranowo 16.68%. Baswedan and Pranowo have refused to concede and alleged fraud in the election.
The official vote-counting process may take up to 35 days; the commission is expected to announce the official winner by March 20.
Colorado snowstorm: A major storm dumped heavy snow Thursday in Colorado, canceling flights and shutting down Interstate 70, which connects Denver to Colorado ski resorts.
The storm, which began Wednesday night, delivered the slushy, wet snow typical for March, one of the snowiest months in Denver, and wasn't expected to wind down until Friday morning.
The heaviest accumulations were expected in the Front Range region, where the eastern plains meet the Rocky Mountains and the vast majority of the state's population lives. Most of the snow was falling in the foothills west of Denver.
Those higher elevations had up to 3 feet of snow by Thursday afternoon; at least a foot more was forecast by Friday morning. Denver got up to 8 inches by Thursday.
Michigan school shooter: The father of a Michigan school shooter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Thursday, a second conviction against the teen's parents who were accused of failing to secure a gun at home and doing nothing to address acute signs of his mental turmoil.
The jury verdict means James Crumbley has joined Jennifer Crumbley as a cause of the killing of four students at Oxford High School in 2021, even without pulling the trigger.
They had separate trials as the first U.S. parents to be charged in a mass school shooting committed by their child.
Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in February.
Ethan Crumbley, now 17, is serving a life sentence in prison for murder and terrorism in the killings.

Full text: FETESTI, Romania -- The jets are ready, and the flight instructors are waiting at a new training center in Romania created to teach Ukraine's pilots to fly the F-16 warplane. But there's a catch: The Ukrainian pilots have yet to arrive, despite declarations last summer that the center would play a crucial role in getting them into the air to defend their country from increasingly deadly Russian strikes.
It's still unclear when Ukrainian pilots will begin training at the center, at the Fetesti air base in southeast Romania, which NATO allies also are using to get schooled on the fighter jets. But the delay is a window into the confusion and chaos that has confronted the military alliance's rush to supply the F-16s.
That is not to say that Ukraine's pilots are not being prepared. Twelve pilots -- fewer than a full squadron -- are expected to be ready to fly F-16s in combat by this summer after 10 months of training in Denmark, Britain and the United States.
But by the time the pilots return to Ukraine, as few as six F-16s will have been delivered out of about 45 of the fighter jets that European allies have promised.
Nevertheless, their highly anticipated arrival over the battlefield will come not a moment too soon. Russia has employed more aggressive air support to gain ground in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks, using its warplanes to send guided glide bombs over long distances into the Ukrainian front lines.
And Ukraine is desperate for more weapons, of any kind, as it runs low on artillery rounds and other ammunition while Republicans in Congress hold up additional U.S. military aid. The F-16s would probably come armed with short- and medium-range missiles and bombs, partially making up for the shortage of ground-based munitions.
"This year, new fighter jets will be in our skies, and we have to make this year an effective one in defending ourselves against Russian guided bombs, Russian aircraft and their missiles," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said March 1.
Yet, officials agreed that much uncertainty remains about when each country will send its jets, how many will be sent, how fast pilots can be trained and how Ukraine will get enough people who can maintain the planes properly.
By normal standards, the training of Ukraine's pilots on the sophisticated Western jets has proceeded at lightning speed, compressing years of classroom learning, simulations and flight exercises into months.
Even so, it is moving more slowly than Ukraine or its allies had hoped, as pilots trained on Soviet-era planes and tactics have had to get up to speed on the English language and Western military practices to make effective use of the F-16s.
Denmark's defense minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said in an email exchange that the "training is progressing well" and noted that Ukraine's pilots were already flying over Danish airspace. But he said their learning curve "ultimately will decide the length of the training."
Denmark was at the forefront of a European push last spring to provide Ukraine with F-16s. Ukrainian officials who had overcome Western resistance to supplying a long series of advanced weapons -- artillery, air defense missiles, tanks -- said the fighter jet was the last major weapon their fighters needed to help them prevail.
The Biden administration reluctantly gave in to Ukraine's demands, allowing allies to provide the F-16s. The jets are produced by Lockheed Martin and are being phased out in some European militaries in favor of newer F-35 warplanes.
But U.S. officials have warned that the F-16s alone would not be decisive in the war, and that, at any rate, the training would take a considerable amount of time.
"There aren't very many Ukrainian pilots to be able to pilot those aircraft," Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told ABC News last month, defending the Biden administration's delay in approving plans to send F-16s to the war. "It's not about whether or not F-16s could possibly have been on the battlefield in the spring of last year."
He said the United States and its allies were now trying to send Ukraine "all of the tools and capabilities that it needs to be able to conduct this fight as rapidly and as efficiently as we possibly can."
The Ukrainian pilots' training began in August at Skrydstrup Air Base, in southern Denmark, but their deficiencies in language skills and knowledge of Western flying techniques slowed things down. Not until January were the Ukrainian pilots ready to fly, Danish officials said.
Initially, officials said, the Ukrainians were sent to Denmark instead of the training center in Romania because it was not yet open when the pilots were ready to begin. The creation of the center at the Fetesti base was announced in July, at a NATO summit, and in November, its instructors began training Romania's own pilots for that country's new F-16 squadron.
Last week, combat-ready Romanian and Turkish pilots guided their F-16s in Romanian airspace about 12 miles from the Black Sea, in a mock intercept of a military cargo plane, to demonstrate their ability to protect NATO airspace. Later, they streaked across the sky in dramatic swooping maneuvers, showing off for journalists assembled at the Fetesti base below.
Like the Ukrainian pilots, Romanian trainees at the base were skilled at flying Soviet- and Russian-made jets when they began the Western courses in November. But unlike the Ukrainians, Romania's pilots already spoke English and were familiar with NATO operating standards.
The next class of eight Ukrainian pilots is scheduled to arrive in Denmark at the end of the summer, but it is not clear when any of them will begin training at Fetesti.
"That's up to the governments and the contracts that support all that," said Col. Bill Thomas, a retired U.S. Air Force officer who is overseeing a Lockheed Martin training program for the Romanian pilots at the Fetesti base. "We're still waiting on all the approvals."
Then there is the matter of the F-16s themselves.
About 50 Ukrainian technicians are being trained in Denmark to support and repair the jets and handle their weapons packages, given that the F-16 is so complex that it generally takes eight to 14 people to maintain each one. Officials said Western defense contractors would have to accompany the jets into Ukraine, and remain with them, until there were enough Ukrainian crews to maintain them properly -- a process that could take years.

Full text: ROME -- Pope Francis said in an interview that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should have the courage to negotiate an end to the war with Russia and not be ashamed to sit at the same table to carry out peace talks.
The pope made his appeal during an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, which was partially released Saturday.
"I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates," Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers.
Ukraine remains firm on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said multiple times the initiative in peace negotiations must belong to the country that has been invaded.
Russia is gaining momentum on the battlefield in the war now in its third year and Ukraine is running low on ammunition. Meanwhile, some of Ukraine's allies in the West are raising the prospect of sending troops.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Saturday that Francis picked up the "white flag" term that had been used by the interviewer. He issued a statement of clarification after the pope's "white flag" comments sparked criticism that he was siding with Russia in the conflict.
Throughout the war, Francis has tried to maintain the Vatican's traditional diplomatic neutrality, but that has often been accompanied by apparent sympathy with the Russian rationale for invading Ukraine, as when he noted that NATO was "barking at Russia's door" with its eastward expansion.
Francis said in the RSI interview that "the word negotiate is a courageous word."
"When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate," he said. "Negotiations are never a surrender."
Federal funding: President Joe Biden signed a $460 billion spending package Saturday to avert a shutdown of critical federal departments even as lawmakers continue to wrestle over a financing blueprint for many other agencies more than halfway into the current fiscal year.
The president finalized the legislation, which will extend funding through the rest of the fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, for about half of the government, including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Justice, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs.
But the rest of the government, including the Pentagon and the Homeland Security Department, remained on short-term life support, facing the prospect of running out of money by March 22 unless Congress and the president can agree on a plan.
Boeing probe opened: The Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the Boeing jetliner blowout that left a gaping hole in an Alaska Airlines plane in January, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.
Citing documents and people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said investigators have contacted some passengers and crew who were on the Jan. 5 flight.
The Boeing plane used by Alaska Airlines suffered the blowout seven minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing. Boeing has been under increased scrutiny since the incident, when a panel that plugged a space left for an extra emergency door blew off a Max 9 jet. There were no serious injuries.
Boeing acknowledged in a letter to Congress on Friday that it cannot find records for work done on the door panel of the Alaska Airlines plane.
Haiti violence: Police and palace guards worked Saturday to retake some streets in Haiti's capital after gangs launched massive attacks on at least three police stations.
Guards from the National Palace accompanied by an armored truck tried to set up a security perimeter around one of the three downtown stations after police fought off an attack by gangs late Friday.
The unrelenting gang attacks have paralyzed the country for more than a week and left it with dwindling supplies of basic goods. Haitian officials extended a state of emergency and nightly curfew Thursday as gangs continued to attack key state institutions.
Caribbean leaders issued a call late Friday for an emergency meeting Monday in Jamaica on what they called Haiti's "dire" situation. They have invited the United States, France, Canada, the U.N. and Brazil to the meeting. Members of the Caricom regional trade bloc have been trying for months to get political actors in Haiti to agree to form an umbrella transitional unity government.
Alabama kidnap hoax: A new plea hearing has been set for an Alabama woman accused of falsely telling police she was abducted last summer after stopping her car to check on a toddler wandering near a highway.
Carlee Russell's two-day disappearance, and her story of being abducted, captivated the nation before police called her story a hoax.
Russell was scheduled for trial March 18, but a court document filed Thursday shows a plea hearing is now set for March 21.
Russell's attorneys appealed her case to circuit court after a municipal judge, in an October ruling, found Russell guilty of misdemeanor charges of false reporting to law enforcement and falsely reporting an incident.
Russell disappeared July 13 after calling 911 to report a toddler beside a stretch of Interstate 459 in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover. She returned home two days later and told police she had been abducted and forced into a vehicle.
Texas copter crash: A helicopter flying over the U.S.-​Mexico border in Texas crashed Friday, killing two National Guard soldiers and a Border Patrol agent, the military said. Another soldier on board was injured.
The UH-72 Lakota helicopter was assigned to the federal government's border security mission when it went down near Rio Grande City, according to a statement released by Joint Task Force North. The cause was under investigation.
Starr County Judge Eloy Vera, the county's top official, said those on board included one woman and three men. He said the injured person was in critical condition.
Nigeria kidnappings: Armed men broke into a boarding school Saturday in northwestern Nigeria and seized 15 children as they slept, police said, about 48 hours after nearly 300 students were taken hostage in the conflict-hit region.
School abductions are common in Nigeria's northern region, especially since the 2014 kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls by Islamic extremists in Borno state's Chibok village shocked the world.

Full text: The fighting had become increasingly ferocious last month at the Zenith air-​defense base a mile south of Avdiivka, where for years a company of Ukrainian soldiers had defended the southern approaches to the city.
Russian troops had moved up on their flanks and were pounding them from many sides with tank, artillery and mortar fire, smashing their defenses and wounding men.
"Every day we tried to repel enemy attacks," said Viktor Biliak, 26, a soldier with the 110th Mechanized Brigade, who had spent 620 days defending the base. "All the fortifications were being destroyed and there was no possibility to build new ones."
Soldiers interviewed after their retreat described an uneven, four-month battle under a relentless onslaught of Russian artillery and glide bombs that destroyed buildings and broke through concrete bunkers. As the Ukrainians took casualties, they became increasingly outnumbered by the Russians assaulting the city, who broke through at two points and quickly seeded areas with fighters.
The fall of the city, when it came in mid-February, was brutal and fast, occurring in less than a week.
For two weeks, as soldiers warned they could be overrun by Russian forces, commanders told them to keep holding their positions, a delay that cost lives, Biliak said. Some units were crumbling under Russian fire.
The final retreat was costly, as Russian artillery fired on the roads leading out of the city. Many Ukrainian soldiers died along the way.
The biggest losses came in the center of the city from the Russian aerial bombardment, said Shaman, 36, a commander of the 25th Separate Battalion, who was monitoring his units from a command post. Some brigades lost contact with units under the bombing. A group retreated to a house and was killed when a glide bomb hit it, said Shaman, who like others interviewed identified himself by his call sign for security reasons.
The capture of Avdiivka was the Russians' most significant gain in nine months and a blow to Ukrainian forces struggling with shortages of ammunition and men.
As they regrouped in the villages and training grounds after their retreat from Avdiivka, Ukrainian soldiers expressed no doubt why they lost the city, a holdout on the eastern front that had been a target of Russian assaults for 10 years.
"It was the lack of ammunition," said Shaman, whose battalion was deployed to Avdiivka in October when the Russians began a new offensive against the city. "No question."
One soldier, Roman, 48, from the Territorial Defense Force, spent three months in Avdiivka with his unit last spring. "It was difficult," he said. "We did not have support."
The unit was sent in February to help defend the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, which served as a headquarters for the Ukrainian military on the edge of the city.
He choked up when describing the casualties his unit had suffered in the war. "We had 20 in the unit, eight remain," he said.
Of his company of 86, only 28 were left, he said.
There is no official count for Ukrainian casualties in Avdiivka, but commanders said hundreds were likely lost. Ukrainian officials say Russian casualties were far higher, as their repeated assaults were met with Ukrainian artillery fire and drone strikes, leaving fields and trenches strewn with bodies and broken armor. But the Russians kept coming and succeeded in reaching the edges of the city from the north and south.
By the end of January they were poised to penetrate the residential areas. They broke in at two places, from the northeast across the railway line, and in the south by tunneling through sewers to attack Ukrainian positions from the rear.
"That was an alarm bell," Biliak said.
Soldiers at the Zenith base began urging their commanders to request to withdraw, he said. They were told to wait.
Inside the city Russia was hurling up to 100 glide bombs, known by the acronym KAB, every day. A single warplane would drop four half-ton bombs, which exploded in quick succession, gouging out massive craters in the earth or flattening multistory buildings.
By early February, Russian troops were close to encircling the city and cutting the last two roads out.
On Feb. 9, Dmytro, 36, the commander of Stugna, a military intelligence unit, was ordered to Avdiivka to help push back the Russian infiltration and secure the main road into the city for the withdrawal of troops.
The unit joined the 3rd Assault Brigade, which had arrived a week earlier, but soldiers found the Russian troops had spread through the neighborhood so fast that their plans were obsolete before they could use them. "The situation was changing by the hour," Dmytro said.
Within days of Stugna's arrival, on Feb. 13, Russian troops seized the main road into the city and began working down a tree line toward a second road to the south, which was the last route out. Already, Ukrainian soldiers were driving through heavy fire to bring in supplies and evacuate the wounded, but thousands of them would be stranded if the Russians seized control of that road.
Nearly surrounded, the men at the Zenith air base received orders to evacuate. A first group did not make it, hit by artillery fire. The main group set out on the night of Feb. 15, walking in small groups across the fields. Biliak led one group, but he said they came under shell fire and he never saw the others again.
By dawn several dozen men regrouped by some cottages on the edge of the city. It was foggy, which meant there were no drones flying, and although they had no orders to do so, they continued falling back toward the only road out.
The road led through the fields and was under constant fire. "You could still dash through with vehicles, but most came out on foot," Dmytro said.
At the chemical plant, soldiers from the 25th Separate Battalion were the last to leave, just before dusk on Feb. 17, heading north on foot.
"There were only 21 of us left to guard the whole plant," said Staf, 36, a tall soldier with an ill-fitting helmet. "They were coming from three sides," he said. "They were within firearms' range," another soldier said. "They were close enough to throw a grenade."
The next day, on their seventh attempt, the Russians took the tree line and cut the lower road, Dmytro said.
"A day earlier," he said, "it would have been chaos."

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Seven people were killed when debris from a Russian drone hit an apartment block in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa overnight, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said Saturday. A 3-month-old baby was among the dead.
Eight other people were injured, authorities said.
Odesa regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said the Shahed drone was shot down by Ukrainian air defenses, and that the falling debris hit the apartment building.
Ukraine's armed forces reported that the Odesa region was attacked by eight drones, seven of which were shot down by air defenses.
Across the country, air defenses shot down 14 of 17 drones launched against Ukraine, according to the armed forces.
Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported Saturday that more than 20 settlements in the eastern Ukrainian province had sustained Russian artillery and mortar attacks, while high-rise buildings in the regional capital, also called Kharkiv, were damaged by a drone attack.
He said there were no casualties, but that three people suffered an "acute stress reaction."
In the partly occupied Kherson region, Russian artillery shelling killed a 53-year-old man Saturday, the Kherson regional prosecutor's office said.
In Russia, a drone struck an apartment building in St. Petersburg on Saturday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.
Six people received medical help after the explosion rocked the building, the agency said.
In Russia's Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine, an investigative team came under attack by a Ukrainian drone, according to the Russian Investigative Committee. Two team members were wounded and two others suffered shock, the committee wrote on Telegram.
Meanwhile, in Germany, authorities Saturday said they were investigating after an audio recording, in which German military officers purportedly discussed support for Ukraine, including the potential use of Taurus missiles, was published in Russia.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was in Rome on Saturday, called it a "very serious matter" and said German authorities were working to clarify the matter "very carefully, very intensively and very quickly."
In the 38-minute recording, military officers discuss the question of how the Taurus long-range cruise missiles could be used by Ukraine. A debate has been taking place in Germany over whether to supply the missiles as Ukraine faces setbacks on the battlefield after two years of war, and with United States military aid held up in Congress.
Last week Scholz said he remained reluctant to send the Taurus missiles to Ukraine, pointing to a risk of Germany becoming directly involved in the war. His hesitancy is a source of friction in his three-party coalition and has also annoyed Germany's conservative opposition.
But in the purported audio recording, German officers discuss the theoretical possibility of the missiles being used in Ukraine.

Full text: As the Russian military launched its offensive on the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka last fall, Ukrainian troops noticed a change in their tactics as column after column of Russian forces were ravaged by artillery fire.
Russian forces divided their infantry formations into smaller units to avoid being shelled, while the amount of Russian airstrikes increased to hammer the city's defenses.
It was one of several adjustments the Russians made to help reverse their fortunes after a disastrous first year. But these changes were obscured by one glaring fact: The Russian military was still far more willing to absorb big losses in troops and equipment, even to make small gains.
Russian forces have a different threshold of pain, one senior Western official said this month, as well as an unorthodox view of what is considered an acceptable level of military losses.
Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have been wounded or killed in the two years since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, including tens of thousands last year in the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut. Another town to the south, Marinka, fell to Russia in January, after heavy fighting and more losses.
Avdiivka was among the most costly.
The various Russian casualty estimates circulating among military analysts, pro-Russian bloggers and Ukrainian officials suggest that Moscow lost more troops taking Avdiivka than it did in 10 years of fighting in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
But casualty numbers are difficult to verify. The official figure of Soviet dead in Afghanistan, around 15,000, is considered to be significantly understated.
One military blogger wrote that the Russians had lost 16,000 troops at Avdiivka, a total that remains impossible to confirm.
"Despite Russia's heavy losses in Avdiivka, they still have a manpower advantage along the front and can continue assaults in multiple directions," said Rob Lee, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, which is based in Philadelphia.
Russia's slow grind forward comes as European nations move to bolster support for Ukraine and strengthen their own protections against potential Russian aggression.
On Monday, NATO cleared the final hurdle for approving Sweden's membership, less than a year after Finland joined, an expansion of the military alliance that defies the hopes of President Vladimir Putin of Russia of fracturing the unity of his adversaries.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said Sunday that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died fighting Russia. But most Western analysts and officials say the toll is far higher.
Since the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia has been willing to pay a high cost to advance in the area of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, where Avdiivka is. Parts of this traditionally Russian-speaking region have been occupied by Russia's proxies since 2014, and in trying to justify the invasion, the Kremlin has spuriously claimed to be defending its Russian speakers, saying they want to be part of Russia.
Some military analysts say taking full control of the Donbas is the bare minimum the Russian government needs to present the invasion of Ukraine as a victory at home.
Avdiivka has been strategic as well as symbolic for Russian war propaganda because of its proximity to Donetsk, the Donbas' largest city, which has been under the Russian-backed occupation since 2014. Securing Avdiivka would move Ukrainian artillery away from the city, reducing civilian casualties and pressure on rear supply lines.
The Kremlin's propensity to fire more shells, mass more people and lean on a much larger and capable air force in this war allowed it to gradually turn the tide against Ukraine's defenses in Avdiivka. The huge cost in wounded and dead, some analysts say, was just the byproduct of a strategy that largely achieved its goal, despite the loss of men and material, especially as Western military aid and Ukrainian ammunition dwindled.
A Russian military analyst close to the defense industry, Ruslan Pukhov, wrote last week that the assault on Avdiivka was part of a wider Russian strategy of pressuring Ukrainian forces along the 600-mile front line in the east with thrusts and probes to exhaust the enemy "by a thousand cuts."
"Such a strategy, however, is quite costly for the Russian Armed Forces in terms of losses, which could lead to depletion of its forces," Pukhov wrote in a Russian current affairs magazine. "This, in turn, could give the Ukrainian side the initiative once again."
Most analysts, however, are issuing sobering assessments of Ukraine's prospects for 2024 if it does not receive U.S. aid. Both sides are struggling to find enough men to continue fighting at the same level of intensity. Russia's much larger population, about 144 million, which is three times that of Ukraine, gives it a significant edge in manpower.
The scale of Russia's losses has partly negated the impact of this arithmetic.
The Kremlin's decision to call up 300,000 men in September 2022 -- for the first time since World War II -- has shocked and unnerved the nation, according to polls. Hundreds of thousands of men had already fled the country when the war began, threatening to shatter the image of normalcy cultivated by Putin.
Since then, the government has tried to postpone another round of mobilization for as long as possible. Instead, it has boosted financial and legal incentives to attract convicts, debtors, migrants and other vulnerable social groups to the front as volunteers. It has also begun to strictly enforce the country's previously lax mandatory military service for young men.
Despite Russian losses in Avdiivka, U.S. officials predict that Russia will continue to put pressure on Ukrainian forces across multiple parts of the front line, hoping Ukraine's units are degraded. The battlefield defeat, along with declining morale -- exacerbated by the U.S. failure to continue supplying ammunition -- might give the Kremlin's formations an opportunity to exploit the situation on the ground.
The Russian military does not, however, have the kind of reserve forces that could immediately exploit the weakened defenses created by the retreat from Avdiivka, those officials said. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the Russian military command had hoped to create a force capable of quick front-line breakthroughs, but that the plan was dashed by the need to reinforce their defenses during last year's Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Local Russians in exile decry war in Ukraine: Anguish still running deep as conflict passes its second anniversary

Full text: As the Kremlin's missiles and armored tanks descended upon Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Max Fedoseev was horrified at the terror unleashed by his native Russia.
"It was just so horrible that my country could start a war with neighbors," recalled the 28-year-old Chicago resident, who was born in Russia and lived there during the invasion.
"It was a nightmare."
At his peril, Fedoseev took to the streets of Russia to protest the war and was arrested several times for peacefully demonstrating, he said.
Fearing reprisal for opposing the authoritarian regime of President Vladimir Putin, he fled to seek asylum in the United States,
resettling in Chicago in August 2022.
But the political dissident continues to speak out against the war and Putin's rule, now in the safety and freedom of his adopted homeland.
As Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine stretches into its third year, Fedoseev is part of a fervent though largely scattered Russian opposition movement. Many of these crusaders have either been imprisoned in Russia or are living in exile abroad, including a stronghold of Russian expats like Fedoseev in the Chicago area.
Their work continues in the wake of the recent loss of prominent Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, 47, whose death in a remote Arctic Circle penal colony has sent shock waves worldwide.
International leaders as well as Russian dissidents around the globe have decried the suspicious death of the charismatic activist, with many holding Putin responsible.
On the full-scale invasion's second anniversary, members of the Russian diaspora gathered in support of Ukraine at a rally Saturday at the Wrigley Building in Chicago, organized by local groups Voice of Free Russia Chicago and Chicago for Democracy in Russia.
The event -- scheduled in conjunction with similar rallies in dozens of cities internationally -- culminated with a march to the Consulate General of Ukraine in Chicago.
The crowd of about 200 chanted "Ukraine needs your help" and "Save Ukraine, save the world." Some carried signs declaring "victory to Ukraine" and "Putin is a war criminal."
"I was very afraid to stand against the propaganda inside my country ... until I met people who were against (the war) too," Oleg Klimenchuk, of Vernon Hills, said at the rally.
He added that he had fled St. Petersburg, Russia, about a year and a half ago, spurred largely by his opposition to the war.
"That's why I ask everyone to say what they think," Klimenchuk said. "Because other people will see that too, and maybe be less afraid."
The somber milestone came a little over a week after the death of Navalny, who remained a steadfast critic of Putin even after surviving poisoning by a Soviet-era nerve agent several years ago as well as multiple prison sentences.
President Joe Biden has blamed Putin for Navalny's death.
"But make no mistake -- make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. Putin is responsible," Biden said on the day Navalny's death was announced. "What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality.
"No one should be fooled -- not in Russia, not at home, not anywhere in the world. Putin does not only target (the) citizens of other countries, as we've seen what's going on in Ukraine right now, he also inflicts terrible crimes on his own people."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has echoed Biden's sentiments.
"It is obvious that (Navalny) was killed by Putin," he said. "Putin doesn't care who dies -- only for him to hold his position.
"This is why he must hold onto nothing. Putin must lose everything and be held responsible for his deeds."
Biden on Friday announced more than 500 new sanctions against Russia, punishment for the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as the death of Navalny.
It's a particularly dangerous time for Russians who oppose their government or protest the ongoing war against Ukraine, a sovereign nation since gaining its independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union.
A California woman with dual Russian-U.S. citizenship was recently arrested by Russian authorities on charges of treason, over a roughly $51 donation she allegedly made to help Ukraine.
Putin signed a law earlier this month permitting Russian forces to confiscate the assets of individuals convicted of spreading "deliberately false information" about the nation's armed forces, which was made a criminal offense as a broader crackdown on dissent after the February 2022 invasion. The measure comes just a few weeks before Putin's run for reelection on March 17.
Hundreds of individuals have also been detained in dozens of cities across Russia while taking part in vigils in Navalny's honor.
In Chicago, the night Navalny was reported dead, a crowd of roughly 150 mourners gathered on Michigan Avenue to light candles and lay flowers beside photographs of the fallen opposition leader.
Some carried signs declaring "You can kill Navalny but not the opposition -- we are here" and "Shame on the Kremlin murderers."
Elena Kaspirovich, co-organizer of the vigil as well as Saturday's rally in support of Ukraine, held a poster of Navalny's portrait with the caption "Not died -- murdered."
"I felt myself so empty, like my hope was killed," said Kaspirovich, who lives in the north suburbs.
Then she remembered the opposition leader's words recorded in the Oscar-winning documentary "Navalny."
"I've got something very obvious to tell you," he had said in Russian. "You're not allowed to give up."
Despite her sorrow Kaspirovich said this missive motivates her to stay strong.
"I realized that now, when he is dead, (we) have the obligation to continue our fight," she said.
Many demonstrators left messages in chalk along the sidewalk of Michigan Avenue near the makeshift memorial that night.
Kaspirovich scrawled three words: "Don't give up."
Aid to Ukraine
The first time Kaspirovich protested in Chicago, her anxiety spiked at the sight of uniformed police officers approaching on bicycles.
"It took time for me to accept that police who were at our protest were not there as an enemy but as a protector," she said. "You have freedom of speech. You are able to gather and do what you want. It was a very unusual experience (for me)."
The 42-year-old married mother of two from Omsk in southwestern Siberia fled Russia with her family about seven years ago, after engaging in political activities and organizing rallies there.
"I felt fear to stay in Russia," she said.
Her childhood was an era of freedom and excitement for the future of Russia, as she witnessed the crumbling of the Soviet Union. The nation seemed headed for democratization and more openness, she recalled.
Yet the past quarter-century under Putin's rule has been marked by increased government crackdown on political protests and deteriorating press freedoms.
Many international relations experts believe Putin hopes to revive the Soviet Union: In 2008 Russian forces attacked Georgia, gaining control of the Abkhazia and so-called South Ossetia regions.
Then in 2014 Russia invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea, a precursor to the full-scale war of today.
"As an ex-Russian citizen, I think the dictatorship in Russia is a huge threat for international peace," Kaspirovich said. "I want Americans to know there are a lot of Russians who are against Putin. And there are a lot of Russians who try to have their voices heard."
When she learned Russia had invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Kaspirovich felt "so ashamed."
"I feel a lot of sorrow for the Ukrainian people," she said. "They were fighting for their freedom and they continue this fight. They need our help. ... This war is unjust and unlawful."
Kaspirovich and other supporters of Ukraine have called on the United States to continue sending the war-torn nation critical military aid.
While the Senate overwhelmingly passed a $95 billion foreign aid package -- which includes $60 billion for Ukraine defense -- the bill has been stalled by some House Republicans including Speaker Mike Johnson, who has refrained from putting the measure up for a vote.
"Putin has not achieved victory in Ukraine and never will if Ukraine receives sufficient support," said Roman Lifanov, who left Novosibirsk, the third-largest city in Russia, a little over a year ago.
The 41-year-old moved to a U.S. city outside of Illinois, which he said he didn't want to identify due to fears for his security. But he frequently comes to Chicago to participate in anti-war and anti-Putin protests.
Lifanov recalled that Putin began intensifying anti-Ukrainian propaganda roughly two decades ago.
"It wasn't as strong as it is now, but it was noticeable to me," he said. "Ukrainians were humiliated on state TV. In Russia, all more or less large TV channels belong to Putin and the state directly, or through Putin's proxy people."
Lifanov's family has Ukrainian ancestry; he said Putin's racist messages had the opposite effect of what was intended, making him "a strong patriot of Ukraine over the years."
When filling out the 2010 Russian census, Lifanov "deliberately and consciously entered my family as Ukrainians," he said.
Lifanov urged American politicians to prioritize Ukraine for the sake of U.S. security as well as international order.
"Lack of will to stop Putin now, when Russia is already weary and divided, would be a grave historical mistake," he said. "Future generations will not understand why those in power did not take action to stop Putin."
Russian forces are investing heavily in disinformation campaigns, Lifanov added, with the aim of "dividing society in Western countries."
"Protect your democracy from fringe demagogues," he warned.
'We stand with Ukraine'
At one protest last year in downtown Chicago, Lifanov donned a Putin mask and fellow demonstrators put him in a faux "jail" made of scrap materials; he traded places with another protester who portrayed opposition leader Navalny, who was symbolically released from the prison.
The moment was cathartic, Lifanov recalled, even if it was only a performance.
Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson earlier this month drew international headlines -- and much rebuke -- for conducting a two-hour interview with Putin, which many critics claimed gave the despot a Western media platform.
Lifanov called the program "propaganda."
"The Kremlin propagates myths that Russia is a 'normal, great country,' that Putin is a reasonable individual, and that it's possible to negotiate with him," he said.
"Carlson's 'interview' with Putin was deeply disappointing. For two hours the former KGB officer, who is a Machiavellian personality, filled the minds of unsuspecting Americans with falsehoods about the real Russia."
Viewing clips from that interview became difficult for 28-year-old Vladislav Iudkin, who said he fled Russia in fall 2022 "after the police started taking interest in me and my wife."
The couple came to the United States seeking asylum and now live in Chicago.
"It's really hard for me to watch Putin ... even in the video," Iudkin said. "When I see him, I recall everything that he took from me."
After receiving information that Russian police were going to pay them a visit, he and his wife left their home in Moscow, Iudkin recalled.
"I was scared, always," Iudkin said.
They had only six hours to pack and make travel arrangements -- leaving their dog and Iudkin's business behind, he said.
"At that time, many opposition members were arrested," he said. "We just knew that we were next. And we had to leave."
An Amnesty International report released in July cited more than 20,000 activists who were subject to reprisal in Russia since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
"Repression in Russia runs deep where a complex and extensive range of tactics are increasingly being weaponized to silence anti-war dissent," the international human rights organization's Russian researcher said in the report.
"The flawed criminal justice system, characterized by deeply unfair trials, has been deployed to dish out prison sentences and hefty fines to silence critics in response to slightest dissent."
Iudkin likened the climate in Russia to life in North Korea, noting that both states suppress free expression and propagate human rights violations. Russians often say "silence is gold," Iudkin noted.
"If you are silent, you can be happy," he said. "If you are speaking, you will get a problem."
Yet Iudkin found he could never ascribe to that philosophy.
At Saturday's rally in support of Ukraine, he and his wife held hand-drawn signs reading "We Stand With Ukraine" on yellow and blue poster board, mirroring the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
"People shouldn't be silent," Iudkin said. "People have to talk about Ukraine. People have to talk about Putin.
"It's not time to be silent."

Full text: After President Joe Biden called President Vladimir Putin of Russia a "crazy SOB" this week, the Kremlin was quick to issue a stern condemnation.
But the image of an unpredictable strongman ready to escalate his conflict with the West is one that Putin has fully embraced after two years of full-scale war.
At home, the Kremlin is maintaining the mystery over the circumstances of the death last week of Alexei Navalny, preventing the opposition leader's family from reclaiming his body.
In Ukraine, Putin is pressing his army to maintain its brutal offensive, boasting on television that he stayed up all night as the city of Avdiivka fell to Russian forces.
And in outer space, U.S. officials warn, Russia may be planning to place a nuclear weapon into orbit, aboard a satellite, which would violate one of the last arms-control treaties.
In power since 1999, Putin, 71, is set to extend his rule to 2030 in Russia's rubber-stamp elections next month. As the vote nears, he is feeding his increasingly overt conception of himself as a history-making leader carrying on the legacy of past rulers who were willing to sacrifice untold numbers of lives to build a stronger Russian state.
But Putin also faces headwinds: a still-determined Ukrainian resistance, a Western alliance that largely remains united and murmurs of discontent in the Russian public. The question is whether Putin, as he exults in leading a "thousand-year, eternal Russia," can avoid the domestic upheaval that has also been a repeated hallmark of the country's history.
"Putin is living in eternity," said Boris Nadezhdin, an anti-war politician who tried to mount a presidential bid to challenge Putin but was barred from the March ballot. Listing rulers dating to the ninth century, he added of Putin: "It's clear he's thinking of himself alongside Oleg the Wise, Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible and perhaps Stalin."
Nadezhdin, who has worked in the Russian government and served in parliament, insisted in a video call interview this week that Putin's grip on power is weaker than meets the eye.
The security, stability and increased prosperity that was long Putin's selling point after the chaos of the 1990s are all waning, Nadezhdin said. "This regime," he went on, "is historically doomed."
Indeed, even as Putin has worked hard to paint a picture of Russia as an invincible state, he has repeatedly been caught off guard. There was the Kremlin's stunning intelligence failure two years ago, when Putin expected Russian troops to be welcomed as liberators and that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government would quickly collapse.
There was the 24-hour uprising staged last summer, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, long viewed as a close Putin ally, brought Russia to the brink of civil war.
And, despite a crackdown on dissent that some analysts describe as more fierce than the late-stage Soviet Union, Russians are still braving arrest to show their disagreement.
A group of women has continued to stage small protests demanding that their mobilized sons and husbands be brought home, people laid flowers in memory of Navalny in scores of Russian cities, and Nadezhdin was able to submit more than 100,000 signatures last month in his bid to get on the presidential ballot with an anti-war message.
Putin is also making it ever more clear that those who cross him should fear for their lives. Russian officials have been celebrating the killing in Spain this month of a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine.
Portraying the invasion of Ukraine as having broad public support is also allowing the Kremlin to justify its crackdown on dissent.
Footage of masked security service officers detaining critics of the war has become commonplace on Russian television. On Tuesday, Russia's domestic security service, known as the FSB, announced that it had arrested a visiting 33-year-old Russian American woman on suspicion of treason.
Her alleged crime: donating about $50 to a Ukrainian charity. She faces 20 years in prison.
News of that arrest came four days after the death of Navalny, who spent more than three years in prison, including about 300 days in solitary "punishment" cells.
But Putin, in public, is keeping his distance from the machinery of repression that he oversees. While a spokesperson said the president had been briefed on Navalny's death, Putin himself has not commented on it.
Instead, Putin revealed this week that he was up late the night after Navalny died, consumed by something else: the war in Ukraine.
In a televised meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin described being briefed in real time on Russia's advance in Avdiivka until 4 a.m. last Saturday.
At 11 a.m., Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the head of Russia's general staff, returned to brief the Russian leader again on Ukraine's rushed withdrawal from the strategically important city, Putin said.
Shoigu said the military had carried out the president's order to set up loudspeakers on the southern Ukrainian front to coax soldiers into surrendering.
The message was geared toward showing Putin as a tireless leader, in tune with all the details of the war.

Full text: As the Kremlin's missiles and armored tanks descended upon Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Max Fedoseev was horrified at the terror unleashed by his native Russia.
"It was just so horrible that my country could start a war with neighbors," recalled the 28-year-old Chicago resident, who was born in Russia and lived there during the invasion. "It was a nightmare."
At his peril, Fedoseev took to the streets of Russia to protest the war, and was arrested several times for peacefully demonstrating, he said. Fearing reprisal for opposing the authoritarian regime of President Vladimir Putin, he fled to seek asylum in the United States, reset
tling in Chicago in August 2022.
But the political dissident continues to speak out against the war and Putin's regime, now in the safety and freedom of his adopted homeland.
As Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine stretches into its third year, Fedoseev is part of a fervent though largely scattered Russian opposition movement. Many of these crusaders have either been imprisoned in Russia or are living in exile abroad, including a stronghold of Russian expats like Fedoseev in the Chicago area.
Their work continues in the wake of the recent loss of prominent Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose death in a remote Arctic Circle penal colony has sent shockwaves worldwide.
International leaders as well as Russian dissidents around the globe have decried the suspicious death of the charismatic activist, with many holding Putin responsible.
On the full-scale invasion's two-year anniversary, members of the Russian diaspora plan to gather in support of Ukraine at a rally Saturday at the Wrigley Building in Chicago, organized by the local groups Voice of Free Russia Chicago and Chicago for Democracy in Russia.
The event -- scheduled in conjunction with similar rallies in dozens of cities internationally -- is expected to culminate with a march to the Consulate General of Ukraine in Chicago.
Fedoseev called Feb. 24 a "tragic" date for both Ukraine and Russia.
"Right now, it is necessary to show our cooperation against this war," he said. "And the main beneficiary of this -- Vladimir Putin."
The somber milestone comes a little over a week after the death of Navalny, who remained a steadfast critic of Putin even after surviving poisoning by a Soviet-era nerve agent several years ago as well as multiple prison sentences.
President Joe Biden has blamed Putin for Navalny's death.
"But make no mistake -- make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. Putin is responsible," Biden said on the day Navalny's death was announced. "What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality. No one should be fooled -- not in Russia, not at home, not anywhere in the world. Putin does not only target (the) citizens of other countries, as we've seen what's going on in Ukraine right now, he also inflicts terrible crimes on his own people."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has echoed Biden's sentiments.
"It is obvious that (Navalny) was killed by Putin," he said. "Putin doesn't care who dies -- only for him to hold his position. This is why he must hold onto nothing. Putin must lose everything and be held responsible for his deeds."
Biden on Friday announced more than 500 new sanctions against Russia, punishment for the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as the death of Navalny.
It's a particularly dangerous time for Russians who oppose their government or protest the ongoing war against Ukraine, a sovereign nation since gaining its independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union.
A California woman with dual Russian-U.S. citizenship was recently arrested by Russian authorities on charges of treason, over a roughly $51 donation she allegedly made to help Ukraine.
Putin signed a law earlier this month permitting Russian forces to confiscate the assets of individuals convicted of spreading "deliberately false information" about the nation's armed forces, which was made a criminal offense as a broader crackdown on dissent after the February 2022 invasion. The measure comes just a few weeks before Putin's run for reelection on March 17.
Hundreds of individuals have also been detained in dozens of cities across Russia while taking part in vigils in Navalny's honor.
In Chicago, the night Navalny was reported dead, a crowd of roughly 150 mourners gathered on Michigan Avenue to light candles and lay flowers beside photographs of the fallen opposition leader.
Some carried signs declaring "You can kill Navalny but not the opposition -- we are here" and "Shame on the Kremlin murderers."
Event co-organizer Elena Kaspirovich held a poster of Navalny's portrait with the caption "Not died -- murdered."
"I felt myself so empty, like my hope was killed," said Kaspirovich, who lives in the north suburbs.
Then she remembered the opposition leader's words recorded in the Oscar-winning documentary "Navalny."
"I've got something very obvious to tell you," he had said in Russian. "You're not allowed to give up."
Despite her sorrow, Kaspirovich said this missive motivates her to stay strong.
"I realized that now, when he is dead, (we) have the obligation to continue our fight," she said.
Many demonstrators left messages in chalk along the sidewalk of Michigan Avenue near the makeshift memorial that night.
Kaspirovich scrawled three words: "Don't give up."
Aid to Ukraine
The first time Kaspirovich protested in Chicago, her anxiety spiked at the sight of uniformed police officers approaching on bicycles.
"It took time for me to accept that police who were at our protest were not there as an enemy but as a protector," she said. "You have freedom of speech. You are able to gather and do what you want. It was a very unusual experience (for me)."

In the days leading up to the invasion's two-year anniversary, he and his wife have been busy creating social media posts decrying the war. They've also made banners they plan to wave at the Chicago rally in support of Ukraine. One says: "We stand with Ukraine."
"People shouldn't be silent," he said. "People have to talk about Ukraine. People have to talk about Putin. It's not time to be silent."

Full text: After President Joe Biden called President Vladimir Putin of Russia a "crazy SOB" this week, the Kremlin was quick to issue a stern condemnation.
But the image of an unpredictable strongman ready to escalate his conflict with the West is one that Putin has fully embraced after two years of full-scale war.
At home, the Kremlin is maintaining the mystery over the circumstances of the death last week of Alexei Navalny, preventing the opposition leader's family from reclaiming his body.
In Ukraine, Putin is pressing his army to maintain its brutal offensive, boasting on television that he stayed up all night as the city of Avdiivka fell to Russian forces.
And in outer space, U.S. officials warn, Russia may be planning to place a nuclear weapon into orbit, aboard a satellite, which would violate one of the last arms-control treaties.
In power since 1999, Putin, 71, is set to extend his rule to 2030 in Russia's rubber-stamp elections next month. As the vote nears, he is feeding his increasingly overt conception of himself as a history-making leader carrying on the legacy of past rulers who were willing to sacrifice untold numbers of lives to build a stronger Russian state.
But Putin also faces headwinds: a still-determined Ukrainian resistance, a Western alliance that largely remains united and murmurs of discontent in the Russian public. The question is whether Putin, as he exults in leading a "thousand-year, eternal Russia," can avoid the domestic upheaval that has also been a repeated hallmark of the country's history.
"Putin is living in eternity," said Boris Nadezhdin, an anti-war politician who tried to mount a presidential bid to challenge Putin but was barred from the March ballot. Listing rulers dating to the ninth century, he added of Putin: "It's clear he's thinking of himself alongside Oleg the Wise, Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible and perhaps Stalin."
Nadezhdin, who has worked in the Russian government and served in parliament, insisted in a video call interview this week that Putin's grip on power is weaker than meets the eye.
The security, stability and increased prosperity that was long Putin's selling point after the chaos of the 1990s are all waning, Nadezhdin said. "This regime," he went on, "is historically doomed."
Indeed, even as Putin has worked hard to paint a picture of Russia as an invincible state, he has repeatedly been caught off guard. There was the Kremlin's stunning intelligence failure two years ago, when Putin expected Russian troops to be welcomed as liberators and that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government would quickly collapse.
There was the 24-hour uprising staged last summer, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, long viewed as a close Putin ally, brought Russia to the brink of civil war.
And, despite a crackdown on dissent that some analysts describe as more fierce than the late-stage Soviet Union, Russians are still braving arrest to show their disagreement.
A group of women has continued to stage small protests demanding that their mobilized sons and husbands be brought home, people laid flowers in memory of Navalny in scores of Russian cities, and Nadezhdin was able to submit more than 100,000 signatures last month in his bid to get on the presidential ballot with an anti-war message.
Putin is also making it ever more clear that those who cross him should fear for their lives. Russian officials have been celebrating the killing in Spain this month of a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine.
Portraying the invasion of Ukraine as having broad public support is also allowing the Kremlin to justify its crackdown on dissent.
Footage of masked security service officers detaining critics of the war has become commonplace on Russian television. On Tuesday, Russia's domestic security service, known as the FSB, announced that it had arrested a visiting 33-year-old Russian American woman on suspicion of treason.
Her alleged crime: donating about $50 to a Ukrainian charity. She faces 20 years in prison.
News of that arrest came four days after the death of Navalny, who spent more than three years in prison, including about 300 days in solitary "punishment" cells.
But Putin, in public, is keeping his distance from the machinery of repression that he oversees. While a spokesperson said the president had been briefed on Navalny's death, Putin himself has not commented on it.
Instead, Putin revealed this week that he was up late the night after Navalny died, consumed by something else: the war in Ukraine.
In a televised meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin described being briefed in real time on Russia's advance in Avdiivka until 4 a.m. last Saturday.
At 11 a.m., Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the head of Russia's general staff, returned to brief the Russian leader again on Ukraine's rushed withdrawal from the strategically important city, Putin said.
Shoigu said the military had carried out the president's order to set up loudspeakers on the southern Ukrainian front to coax soldiers into surrendering.
The message was geared toward showing Putin as a tireless leader, in tune with all the details of the war.

Full text: Russian forces in recent days have launched multiple attacks around the southern Ukrainian village of Robotyne, military officials and experts said, targeting land hard-won by Ukraine in a rare success of its counteroffensive last summer.
The Ukrainian army said it had repelled four consecutive days of assaults, from Saturday to Tuesday, involving armored vehicles and large numbers of troops that had massed near Robotyne, about 50 miles southeast of Zaporizhzhia. This comes after the Donetsk-area town of Avdiivka, about 100 miles east of Robotyne, fell last week.
Open-source maps of the battlefield compiled by independent groups analyzing combat footage suggest that Russia has made marginal gains to the west and south of Robotyne. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, said Monday that Russian forces had advanced to the western outskirts of the village.
"Pay attention to the village of Robotyne," Dmytro Lykhovii, a spokesperson for Ukrainian forces fighting in the area, said on national television last week. "It seems that the Russians have set a goal of achieving some success there" and planned to try to seize the village.
The weekend assaults around Robotyne came as Russian forces took the front-line city of Avdiivka and attacked Ukrainian positions on the east bank of the Dnieper River, more than 130 miles to the west. Military analysts say these near-simultaneous assaults are designed to apply pressure across the front line to reduce Kyiv's ability to withdraw and replenish exhausted troops and force it to burn through its scarce stocks of ammunition.
"They are trying in different places, testing the Ukrainian defenses," said Pasi Paroinen of the Black Bird Group, which analyzes satellite imagery and social media content from the battlefield. "They are probing and seeking weaknesses."
Serhii Kuzan, chair of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group, said Moscow would try to build on its success on the eastern front in the coming weeks and "cut off Robotyne at any costs." He and other analysts said Moscow had tens of thousands of troops around Robotyne, and he predicted that attacks would intensify.
Russia's gains around Robotyne, a village of just a few hundred inhabitants before the war, have been limited. The village fell under Russian occupation shortly after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. It was retaken by Ukrainian forces in August, after weeks of combat that underlined the immense challenges Kyiv faces in punching through dense Russian defenses erected in the area.
Today, Robotyne sits in a bulge carved into Russian-held territory, surrounded to the west, south and east by Moscow's troops. In recent weeks, Russian forces have been attacking the flanks of this pocket and gradually recaptured small stretches of land, using what the Ukrainian military has described as small assault groups backed by armored vehicles.
"The situation is dynamic there, the enemy is inflicting heavy fire," Lykhovii said Monday.
Geolocated footage of the battlefield showed Russian attack drones hitting Ukrainian-held trenches just a few hundred yards south of Robotyne. Rybar, a prominent Russian military blogger, said Russian troops had gained a foothold on the southern outskirts of Robotyne and that fighting was now taking place in the village, which was largely reduced to rubble during the fighting last summer. His claim could not be independently confirmed.
Paroinen said Russia had retaken some fortifications lost in the summer counteroffensive. He added that Robotyne is not easy for Ukrainian soldiers to defend because Russian troops control the high ground around the area.
"In general, that's a big problem for the Ukrainians there," he said, adding that Russia had positioned three divisions around Robotyne, between 30,000 and 40,000 soldiers, including some elite paratrooper units.
Kuzan said he expected that some troops involved in the capture of Avdiivka would now be "redeployed to other parts of the front line in the coming days," possibly around Robotyne to help with the offensive push there.
Ukraine's military said Monday that its troops had taken up new defensive positions outside of Avdiivka, in an attempt to stop further Russian advances.
On Wednesday, the European Union said it would impose new sanctions against Russia that would target companies, including ones based in China and Turkey, that make components for drones used by Russia in Ukraine.
"We must keep degrading Putin's war machine," said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announcing the news on social media.
Meanwhile, a pro-war Russian military blogger died Wednesday, his lawyer said, after the blogger said the country's military pressured him to remove a post exposing the scale of its losses in a recent battle in Ukraine.
The blogger, Andrei Morozov, claimed in his post that Russia had lost 16,000 men and 300 armored vehicles in its assault on Avdiivka, which the Russians captured last week. He deleted the post Tuesday after what he said was a campaign of intimidation against him.
His lawyer, Maksim Pashkov, confirmed the death. He did not specify a cause.

Full text: President Joe Biden said he would be willing to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson to discuss an emergency funding package for Ukraine and Israel, after White House officials previously dismissed the utility of direct talks.
"I'd be happy to meet with him if he has anything to say," Biden told reporters Monday after returning to the White House from his weekend in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
The president's remarks are a signal the White House is intensifying its effort to secure passage for a $95 billion aid bill, which also includes funding for the Indo-Pacific and aid for Palestinian civilians.
Supporters of the package, which passed the Senate in a 70-29 vote, have argued the fall of the Ukrainian city of Avdiivka to Russian forces and the death last week of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a Siberian prison intensified the need for quick passage of the funding.
"We're making a big mistake not responding," Biden told reporters, adding that he hoped the death of Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin's most formidable domestic critic, would rally support behind the legislation.
Biden said he was considering new sanctions on Russia over Navalny's death.
The president's willingness to engage in one-on-one negotiations comes after his aides had cast such a session as unproductive last week, noting the Republican leader's shifting demands for a foreign aid bill.
Johnson, who clings to a narrow majority in the House, had insisted foreign aid funding be married to new border-control measures -- only to reject a bipartisan package negotiated in the Senate at the urging of former President Donald Trump, Biden's likely opponent in November's presidential election.
"What is there to negotiate? Really? Truly? What is the one-on-one negotiation about when he's been presented with exactly what he asked for? So, he's negotiating with himself. He's killing bills on his own," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.
Lawmakers are on recess so it's not clear when a meeting might be scheduled.

Full text: MUNICH -- As the leaders of the West gathered in Munich over the past three days, President Vladimir Putin had a message for them: Nothing they've done so far -- sanctions, condemnation, attempted containment -- would alter his intentions to disrupt the current world order.
Russia made its first major gain in Ukraine in nearly a year, taking Avdiivka, at huge human cost to both sides, the bodies littered along the roads a warning, perhaps, of a new course in the 2-year-old war.
Alexei Navalny's suspicious death in a remote Arctic prison made it clearer that Putin will tolerate no dissent.
And the American discovery, disclosed in recent days, that Putin may be planning to place a nuclear weapon in space -- a bomb designed to wipe out the connective tissue of global communications if Putin is pushed too far -- was a potent reminder of his capacity to strike back at his adversaries with the asymmetric weapons that remain key to his power.
In Munich, the mood was anxious and unmoored, as leaders faced confrontations they had not anticipated. Warnings about Putin's possible next moves were mixed with Europe's growing worries that it could soon be abandoned by the U.S., the one power that has been at the core of its defense strategy for 75 years.
Barely an hour went by at the Munich Security Conference in which the conversation did not turn to the question of whether the U.S. Congress would fail to find a way to fund new arms for Ukraine, and if so, how long the Ukrainians could hold out.
While former President Donald Trump's name was rarely mentioned, the prospect of whether he would make good on his threats to pull out of NATO and let Russia "do whatever the hell they want" with allies he judged insufficient hung over much of the dialogue.
Yet European leaders seemed to sense how slowly they had reacted to the new realities. European plans to rebuild their own forces for a new era of confrontation were moving in the right direction, leader after leader insisted, but then they added it would take five years or more -- time they may not have if Russia overwhelms Ukraine, and Trump undermines the alliance.
The dourness of the mood contrasted sharply with just a year ago, when many of the same participants -- intelligence chiefs and diplomats, oligarchs and analysts -- thought Russia might be on the verge of strategic defeat in Ukraine. There was talk of how many months it might take to drive the Russians back to the borders that existed before their invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.
Now that optimism appeared premature at best, faintly delusional at worst.
Nikolai Denkov, prime minister of Bulgaria, argued that Europeans should draw three lessons from the cascade of troubles. The war in Ukraine was not just about gray zones between Europe and Russia, he argued, but "whether the democratic world we value can be beaten, and this is now well understood in Europe."
Second, European nations have realized that they must combine their forces in military, not just economic endeavors, to build up their own deterrence, he said.
And third, they needed to separate Ukraine's urgent needs for ammunition and air defense from longer-term strategic goals.
But given the imperialist rhetoric of Russia's leaders, Denkov said, "long term in this case means three to five and maximum 10 years -- it is really urgent."
U.S. officials reached for the familiar assurance that Washington's leadership and commitment remained unchanged. But they could not describe a plan of action for Ukraine when Congress was still holding up funds for arms, and they struggled to explain how they would achieve a sustainable peace after the Israel-Hamas war.
In the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, the conference stage where Putin warned in 2007 that NATO's eastern expansion was a threat to Russia, Navalny's widow made an emotional appearance Thursday hours after her husband's death, reminding attendees that Putin would "bear responsibility" for it.
But there was little discussion of what the West could do. When a senior U.S. official was asked how the United States would make good on President Joe Biden's 2021 pledge of "devastating consequences" for Russia if Navalny died in prison, the official shrugged.
"I feel underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed" by the debate here, said Steven Sokol, president of the American Council on Germany. "There was a lack of urgency and a lack of clarity about the path forward, and I did not see a strong show of European solidarity."

Full text: KHARKIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine ordered the complete withdrawal from the decimated city of Avdiivka before dawn Saturday, surrendering a position that had been a military stronghold for the better part of a decade, in the face of withering Russian assault.
"Based on the operational situation around Avdiivka, in order to avoid encirclement and preserve the lives and health of servicemen, I decided to withdraw our units from the city and move to defense on more favorable lines," Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine's top military commander, said in a statement.
The fall of Avdiivka, a city that was once home to some 30,000 people but is now a smoking ruin, is the first major gain Russian forces have achieved since May of last year. After rebuffing a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the summer and fall, Russian forces in recent weeks have been pressing the attack across nearly the entire length of the 600-mile-​long front.
The Ukrainian withdrawal Saturday follows a bloody endgame that saw some of the fiercest fighting of the nearly two-year-old war. Relying on its superiority in personnel and weaponry, Russia pounded the city with aerial bombardments and ground assaults, even as its fighters suffered staggering casualties.
Outgunned Ukrainian forces had begun withdrawing from positions in the southern part of the city Wednesday and since then have been engaged in a desperate battle to avoid encirclement inside the city as Russian forces advanced from multiple directions. As Russian bombers pummeled Avdiivka, Ukraine said its forces shot down three Russian warplanes.
Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, head of Ukraine's forces in the south, said there had been no choice but to withdraw, given the Russian advantage in firepower and the number of soldiers Russia was willing to throw into the battle.
"In a situation where the enemy is advancing on the corpses of their own soldiers with a 10-to-1 shell advantage, under constant bombardment, this is the only correct solution," he said in a statement.
The commander said that there were losses for the Ukrainians and "at the final stage of the operation, under pressure from the superior forces of the enemy, some Ukrainian servicemen fell into captivity."
Even if Ukrainian lines stabilize in the rear of Avdiivka, the city's fall into Russian control will allow Moscow's military to move its troops and equipment more efficiently as it presses in other directions.
"Avdiivka is a very important strong point in the Ukrainian system of defense," because it protects Pokrovsk, about 30 miles to the northwest, a logistical hub for the Ukrainian army, said Mykola Bielieskov, a military analyst at the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Ukraine. "Taking control of Avdiivka might create an opening for Russia."
Soldiers reached by phone Friday, who asked not to be identified, given the ongoing military action, described a harrowing bid to escape the city. They gave accounts of racing past blasted-out buildings as shells thundered from all around and Russians pressed in from several directions.
"In one of the sectors in the town, fighters from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade find themselves completely surrounded, but they are attempting to break through, and they succeed," Maj. Rodion Kudryashov, deputy commander of the assault brigade, said in an interview with Radio Liberty.
Some expressed concern privately in interviews that the call to withdraw had come too late, or posted stark accounts on social media of their dangerous and chaotic retreat.
Soldiers posting videos on social media provided a window into how dangerous movement in the area had become.
In one video, several Ukrainian soldiers ride atop an armored vehicle just half a mile from the Avdiivka Coke Chemical Plant on the northwestern edge of the city, a landmark.
They drive past the sign "Avdiivka is Ukraine" at the entrance to the city, made famous when President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a selfie video from there in December. Seconds later, the soldiers duck and grimace as shells land just yards from them, throwing up clouds of dust and dirt.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told the Kremlin that Russian forces were working to clear the final pockets of resistance at the plant, officials said in a statement.
Videos appeared to show soldiers raising the Russian flag over one of the plant's buildings.

Full text: PARIS -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement with France hours after he formalized a similar one with Germany. The agreements send a strong signal of long-term backing as Kyiv works to shore up Western support nearly two years after Russia launched its full-scale war.
Zelenskyy was greeted in Paris at the Elysee presidential palace by President Emmanuel Macron.
The agreement provides an additional package worth $3.2 billion in military aid this year, the largest annual amount France has given to Ukraine since the war began.
"The outcome of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine will be decisive for our interests, our values, our security and our model of society," Macron said.
Zelenskyy stopped in France after he met earlier in the day in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said Berlin was providing another $1.2 billion package of military aid, including 36 howitzers, 120,000 artillery rounds and two more air-defense systems.
Ukraine signed its first such bilateral agreement last month with the U.K.
"These three agreements ... give me confidence as president that we are not alone," Zelenskyy said in Paris.
"It's very important that we have specific agreements with all our partners. But I would like to emphasize that this is not an alternative to the United States, we are all together," he said.
Zelenskyy earlier said more deals were in the works with other countries. "Ukraine has never yet had more valuable and stronger documents," he said.
The security agreements appear aimed primarily at sending a message of long-term solidarity as Ukraine has gone back on the defensive in the war, hindered by low ammunition supplies and a shortage of personnel.
Maine shooter's threat: An Army reservist responsible for Maine's deadliest mass shooting told state police in New York before his hospitalization last summer that fellow soldiers were worried about him because he was "gonna friggin' do something."
Reservist Robert Card told troopers who escorted him to a hospital in upstate New York that fellow reservists and others kept talking about him behind his back, "and it's getting old," according to police bodycam video obtained by WMTW-TV and others under New York's Freedom of Information Law.
"They're scared 'cause I'm gonna friggin' do something. Because I am capable," Card said.
The release of the video recorded July 16 followed the release of a new detail Thursday by Maine State Police who addressed an independent commission investigating the tragedy: A review of Card's cellphone revealed a note he had written three days before the Oct. 25 shooting in Lewiston in which he said he'd "had enough" and warned he was "trained to hurt people."
The 40-year-old Card killed 18 people and wounded 13 at a bowling alley and a bar. Card's body was found two days later. He had died by suicide.
Protection for Haley: A group of top congressional leaders has recommended that Republican candidate Nikki Haley receive protection from the U.S. Secret Service after she reported a growing number of threats during her presidential campaign, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.
The committee voted in favor of granting the protective detail after considering the seriousness of the threats and reviewing national polling data, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The recommendation has been forwarded to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who will make the final decision. The Secret Service already has several standby security teams and the protective detail could be dispatched to protect the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador on the same day the authorization is approved, the person said.
The Secret Service is legally required to protect presidential and vice presidential candidates and their families 120 days out from a general election. However, the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in its 2024 budget overview that recent requests for candidate protection were coming in earlier than in the past.
AI elections accord: Major technology companies signed a pact Friday to voluntarily adopt "reasonable precautions" to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to disrupt democratic elections around the world.
Executives from Adobe, Amazon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok gathered at the Munich Security Conference in Germany to announce a new framework for how they respond to AI-generated deepfakes that trick voters. Twelve other companies, including Elon Musk's X, are also signing on to the accord.
The accord is largely symbolic, but targets realistic AI-generated images, audio and video "that deceptively fake or alter the appearance, voice, or actions of political candidates, election officials, and other key stakeholders in a democratic election, or that provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote."
The companies aren't committing to ban or remove deepfakes. Instead, the accord outlines methods they will use to try to detect and label deceptive AI content.
Manchin won't run: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, announced Friday that he is not running for president, saying he didn't want to be a "spoiler."
"I will not be seeking a third-party run," he said in a speech at West Virginia University billed as part of a national listening tour Manchin announced when he decided not to seek another Senate term. "I will not be involved in a presidential run. I will be involved in making sure that we secure a president that has the knowledge and has the passion and has the ability to bring this country together."
Colorado human remains: Colorado authorities issued an arrest warrant Friday for a former funeral home owner they say kept a deceased woman's body in a hearse for two years at a home where police also found the cremated remains of at least 30 people.
The grisly discovery occurred Feb. 6 during a court-ordered eviction of a house rented by Miles Harford, 33, owner of Apollo Funeral and Cremation Services in the Denver suburb of Littleton, police said. It had been closed since September 2022.
The discovery is the latest in a string of horrific cases in recent years involving mishandled bodies by funeral home operators in Colorado, which has some of the weakest oversight of the funeral industry in the nation. The state has no routine inspections of funeral homes or qualification requirements for operators.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- A missile strike Thursday on the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border killed six people, including a child, and injured 18, a Russian official said. It was the latest in exchanges of long-range missile and rocket fire in Russia's war on Ukraine.
Hours earlier, Russia fired two dozen cruise and ballistic missiles at a broad area of Ukraine, hitting multiple regions after a midnight strike in Ukraine's northeast killed five people in an apartment building, authorities said.
Five of the 18 people injured in Belgorod, a city of around 340,000 people, are children, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. Tass news agency reported that 15 people were hospitalized.
A shopping center and a school stadium were hit in Belgorod. "There are many casualties: dead and wounded," Roman Starovoit, the governor of Russia's Kursk region, which is next to Belgorod, said on Telegram.
Russia's Ministry of Defense said air defense systems destroyed 14 missiles over the Belgorod region that were launched by Ukraine using a RM-70 Vampire multiple launch rocket system.
Belgorod, 25 miles north of the Ukraine border, has been a regular target of Ukrainian fire, putting its residents on edge. Dozens of people were killed and injured in an attack there over Russia's New Year holiday weekend.
Frequent Russian long-range bombardments are occurring as the almost two-year war has become bogged down in mostly trench and artillery warfare, which is destructive but not bringing much change to the 930-mile front line.
Thursday's salvos on Ukraine were notable for the geographic spread of its targets and the wide variety of missiles deployed by the Kremlin's forces.
Putin talks US election: President Vladimir Putin said Russia would prefer to see U.S. President Joe Biden win a second term, describing him as more experienced and predictable than former President Donald Trump -- even though Moscow strongly disagrees with Biden's policies.
Putin's comments during an interview Wednesday with Russian state television were his first about the upcoming election, likely to pit Biden against Trump. They were rare praise for Biden, a fierce critic of the Russian leader who has frequently lauded Trump.
"Biden, he's more experienced, more predictable, he's a politician of the old formation," Putin said when asked which candidate would be better for Russia. "But we will work with any U.S. leader whom the American people trust."
Putin's motives for saying Biden is a better choice for Russia were unclear. His apparent endorsement was not welcomed by the White House.
Asked during a briefing Thursday about Putin's remarks, national security spokesman John Kirby responded: "I think Mr. Putin knows very well what this administration has been doing to counter Russia's malign influence around the world. Mr. Putin should just stay out of our elections."
New data on drug use: Smoking has surpassed injecting as the most common way of taking drugs in U.S. overdose deaths, a new government study suggests.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called its study, published Thursday, the largest to look at how Americans took the drugs that killed them.
CDC officials decided to study the topic after seeing reports from California suggesting that smoking fentanyl was becoming more common than injecting it. Potent, illicit versions of the painkiller -- which increasingly has been cut into heroin or other drugs -- are involved in more U.S. overdose deaths than any other drug.
Some early research has suggested that smoking fentanyl is somewhat less deadly than injecting it, and any reduction in injection-related overdose deaths is a positive, said the study's lead author, Lauren Tanz.
CDC investigators studied the trend by using a national database built from death certificates, toxicology reports and reports from coroners and medical examiners.
Massacre delay defended: Maine state police defended a delay in their October search for a gunman who had just killed 18 people, saying Thursday that after finding his abandoned car, they feared he could be planning an ambush.
It took police two days to find the body of former Army reservist Robert Card, who died by suicide, while tens of thousands of Maine residents were ordered to shelter in their homes.
Police have been criticized for not finding Card sooner, after they quickly identified him, found his car and twice searched a nearby recycling facility. They found his body there on a third search.
"We would essentially be asking a patrol officer, with their canine, to go into the woods without the ability to see at night" to face off against a man with military training, Maj. Lucas Hare told a panel investigating the Lewiston shooting.
Hare also described some of the confusion and tension during the search as multiple police agencies descended on the area, including some officers who showed up on their own, and emergency calls flooded in.
Greece OKs gay marriage: Greece became the first Orthodox Christian country to legalize same-sex civil marriage, despite opposition from the influential, socially conservative Greek Church.
A cross-party majority of 176 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament voted late Thursday in favor of the bill drafted by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' center-right government. Seventy-six others rejected the reform, two abstained from the vote and 46 were not present in the house.
Mitsotakis tweeted after the vote that Greece "is proud to become the 16th (European Union) country to legislate marriage equality."
Opinion polls suggest that most Greeks support the proposed reform by a narrow margin.
New charges in beheading: The suburban Philadelphia man charged with decapitating his father and posting a video online in which he held up the severed head had a device with photos of federal buildings and apparent instructions for making explosives when he was arrested, authorities said Thursday.
Justin Mohn, 32, faces a dozen new charges, including terrorism and theft, in the death last month of Michael Mohn, the Bucks County district attorney's office said Thursday.
A woman who answered the phone at the Bucks County public defender's office, listed as Mohn's attorney, declined to comment Thursday.
Prosecutors say Mohn fatally shot his father, 68, with a pistol he bought the day before and then used a kitchen knife and machete to decapitate him at the Levittown house where they lived.
A preliminary hearing is set for April 2.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that the U.S. House will not feel "rushed" to pass the $95.3 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, signaling a further stall over sending military hardware and munitions that Kyiv badly needs to fight Russia.
Johnson made the remarks behind closed doors at a morning meeting of House Republicans, who are largely aligned with former President Donald Trump, the party's presidential front-runner, in opposing the Senate-passed aid for Ukraine's fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.
The speaker let colleagues know that the House will instead "work its will," in considering the package, said a person familiar with the private remarks and granted anonymity to discuss them.
"The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill," Johnson said at a news conference afterward.
Johnson, who rejected a border security compromise that was eventually stripped from the final product, said the Senate's package "does nothing" to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, which has been the GOP's priority.
The slow-walk of U.S. aid to an ally during the largest ground war in Europe since World War II shows how far Republicans have retreated from overseas leadership in line with Trump.
While Johnson has said he personally supports aid for Ukraine, he leads a far-right majority that is more closely aligned with Trump's isolationist ideology and, increasingly, a hands-off approach to Putin's aggression.
Biden has warned that refusal to take up the bill would be "playing into Putin's hands."
Georgia election case: A Georgia judge who is deciding whether to toss Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis off the state's election interference case against former President Donald Trump has set a hearing for Thursday that is expected to focus on details of Willis' personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.
As soon as allegations of an inappropriate romantic relationship between Willis and attorney Nathan Wade surfaced last month, speculation about the future of the case began to swirl. Even if the prosecution isn't derailed, the upheaval has certainly created an unwanted distraction for Willis and her team and could undermine public confidence in the case.
Onetime White House aide Michael Roman's motion says Willis and Wade were romantically involved when she hired him in November 2021 to manage an investigation into whether Trump and others committed any crimes as they tried to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. That investigation led to the indictment in August of Trump and 18 others who are accused of participating in a sprawling illegal scheme to keep Trump in office.
Four of the people charged have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the remaining 14 have all pleaded not guilty.
No ballot stuffing: A conservative group has told a Georgia judge that it doesn't have evidence to support its claims of illegal ballot stuffing during the 2020 general election and a runoff two months later.
Texas-based True the Vote filed complaints with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in 2021, including one in which it said it had obtained "a detailed account of coordinated efforts to collect and deposit ballots in drop boxes across metro Atlanta" during the November 2020 election and a January 2021 runoff.
A Fulton County Superior Court judge in Atlanta signed an order last year requiring True the Vote to provide evidence it had collected, including the names of people who were sources of information, to state elections officials who were frustrated by the group's refusal to share evidence with investigators.
In their written response, attorneys for True the Vote said the group had no names or other documentary evidence to share.
Iran pipeline blasts: Explosions struck a natural gas pipeline in Iran early Wednesday, with an official blaming the blasts on a "sabotage and terrorist action" in the country as tensions remain high in the Middle East amid Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The blasts hit a natural gas pipeline running from Iran's western Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province up north to cities on the Caspian Sea. The roughly 790-mile pipeline begins in Asaluyeh, a hub for Iran's offshore South Pars gas field.
Saeed Aghli, the manager of Iran's gas network control center, told Iranian state television that a "sabotage and terrorist" action caused explosions along several areas of the line.
There are no known insurgent groups operating in that province, home to the Bakhtiari, a branch of Iran's Lur ethnic group. Aghli did not name any suspects in the blasts.
Iran's Oil Minister Javad Owji, also speaking to state TV, compared the attack to a series of mysterious and unclaimed assaults on gas pipelines in 2011 -- including around the anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Tehran marked the 45th anniversary of the revolution Sunday.
Indonesia election: A former general linked to past human rights abuses claimed victory Wednesday in Indonesia's presidential election, a result that would raise questions about the commitment to democratic values in the sprawling island nation that is the world's third largest democracy.
Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, 72, presented himself as an heir to immensely popular sitting President Joko Widodo, whose son was his running mate.
Citing unofficial results, Subianto told thousands of supporters in the capital, Jakarta, that his victory was "the victory of all Indonesians."
There was no declaration by election officials, and the two former provincial governors who also competed in the balloting did not concede defeat.
Japanese moon craft: An unmanned spacecraft has captured and transmitted data analyzing 10 lunar rocks, a greater-than-expected achievement that could help provide clues about the origin of the moon, a Japan space agency official said Wednesday.
For four days, the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM -- which landed on the moon upside down Jan. 20 -- has used its multi-band spectral camera to study rock composition, and worked on examining lunar rocks, said Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency project manager Shinichiro Sakai.
The landing made Japan the world's fifth country to reach the moon, after the U.S., the Soviet Union, China and India.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine said Wednesday that its forces had sunk a large Russian ship off the coast of Crimea before dawn, in what would be another powerful blow against the Russians at sea, as outgunned Ukrainian soldiers struggle to hold back bloody assaults on land.
The Ukrainian military released footage of the strike, which it said had resulted in the sinking of the 360-foot-long landing ship Caesar Kunikov, possibly complicating Russia's logistical efforts in southern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian claim could not be immediately confirmed, but when NATO's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, was asked about the attack, he called Ukraine's campaign on the Black Sea a "great achievement."
"The Ukrainians have been able to inflict heavy losses on the Russian Black Sea Fleet," he said at a news conference in Brussels. Russia has lost more than one-third of its fleet since the war began, according to Ukrainian officials and military analysts.
Russia declined to comment on the attack.
At the same time, however, Ukrainian ground forces find themselves in perhaps their most precarious position since the opening months of the Russian invasion.
"The enemy is now advancing along almost the entire front line, and we have moved from offensive operations to conducting a defensive operation," Ukraine's top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, told the German outlet ZDF in his first interview since being promoted to the post last week.
Russia has yet to achieve a major breakthrough on the front this winter. The epicenter of the current fighting is around the battered city of Avdiivka, a longtime Ukrainian stronghold in the east. Russian forces have broken through Ukraine's defenses to enter the city in multiple locations and are threatening to cut off the main supply line for Ukrainian defenders.
The government in Kyiv has dispatched reinforcements, but soldiers fighting there have said it is unclear how long they can hold out. A growing shortage of ammunition has forced local commanders to ration shells, making it more difficult to push back the Russian advance.
Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the area said the other problem is the number of aviation bombs Russian warplanes are dropping daily, demolishing even heavily fortified positions.
"They destroy everything," said Serhii, the 40-year-old commander of an assault platoon fighting in the east who was identified by first name only in accordance with military protocol. "Nothing is left there. Plus the shock wave injures the guys, mutilates them, and so on."
Dmytro Lykhoviy, the spokesperson for Ukrainian forces around Avdiivka, said the Russians have deployed 50,000 soldiers to the fight, including armored units engaged in fierce battles in the city.
"The situation on the front line is dynamic and can change literally every hour," he said. "Our troops are making every effort to hold their positions."

Senators clear hurdle on foreign aid: Rare bipartisan vote keeps $95B bill for Israel, Ukraine afloat

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Sunday pushed a $95 billion emergency aid bill for Ukraine and Israel past a critical hurdle, with a bipartisan vote that kept the legislation on track for passage within days.
The vote was 67-27 to move forward on the package, which would dedicate $60.1 billion to helping Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression, send $14.1 billion to Israel for its war against Hamas and fund almost $10 billion in humanitarian assistance for civilians in conflict zones, while addressing threats to the Indo-Pacific region.
In a rare Sunday session, 18 Republicans joined Democrats to advance the measure, which leaders hope the Senate will approve as early as Tuesday.
"It's no exaggeration to say the eyes of the world are on the United States Senate," Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, said on the floor Sunday, appealing to his colleagues to back the bill.
He maintained that U.S. allies "don't have the luxury of pretending that the world's most dangerous aggressors are someone else's problem, and neither do we."
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, said on the floor, "We're going to keep working on this bill until the job is done."
He commended Republicans who had backed the measure for "working in good faith to get this done" and asserted that it was "essential" for the Senate to pass the legislation. It had been decades, Schumer added, since Congress considered a bill "that so significantly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the very security of Western democracy and our ideals."
But steep hurdles still remain for the bill in the Republican-led House, where it faces staunch opposition fueled by the "America First" stance of former President Donald Trump.
The bipartisan endorsement in the Senate came over the bitter opposition of right-wing Republicans who have railed against the measure, contending that the United States should not be continuing to send tens of billions of dollars to bolster Ukraine's security, particularly without first doing more to secure its own border with Mexico against an influx of migration.
They have continued to make that argument even after voting last week to kill a version of the aid bill that included a border crackdown, saying it did not go far enough.
Many Republican opponents also have taken issue with the billions of dollars the bill would devote to humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, as well as $7.9 billion in economic aid to prop up Ukraine's domestic infrastructure during wartime.
"We did spend four months promising the American people that we would secure our own border before we focused on other countries' borders," Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said on "Fox News Sunday," adding that he also had "serious concerns about the $19 billion of nondefense aid in there."
Cotton voted last week with most of his party to kill the bipartisan border plan.
Trump has stoked the resistance, urging Republican lawmakers to reject the bipartisan border plan and egging on House GOP leaders, who promised that it would be dead on arrival in their chamber.
Trump has also made no secret of his opposition to funding Ukraine's military campaign to push back a Russian invasion, a stance he underscored during a campaign rally Saturday by suggesting that, if reelected, he would not defend U.S. allies against threats from Moscow if the allies did not pay for defense.
Trump described the United States' role in preserving the global democratic order as strictly transactional, declaring that if a NATO member failed to commit the requisite funds to bolster the organization's collective security, he would refuse to defend them against a Russian attack.
Of Russia, he added: "I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."
NATO members are expected to commit at least 2% of their gross domestic product to military spending, a threshold that most of its member nations have not met.
Sunday's action amounted to a repudiation of Trump's stance by Democrats and a determined bloc of Republicans, led by McConnell, who have maintained that it is imperative that the United States continue to come to Ukraine's aid militarily to send a signal to the rest of the world's dictators.
"Deterrence is not divisible; American credibility is not divisible," Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said on the floor Friday, adding, "You can't say, 'We're going to be real strong in the Taiwan Strait, but you know -- no problem in Ukraine.' "
Democrats predicted that enough Republicans would ultimately reject Trump's pressure for the Senate to pass the measure.
"It has been hard to get Republican votes to support Ukraine, made very difficult by Donald Trump's opposition to Ukraine funding, but I think we're going to get this done," Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation."
He warned that the United States would be "on the precipice of a disaster" that could lead Russian President Vladimir Putin to threaten NATO allies if the Senate failed to pass the bill.
The bipartisan coalition that has carried the bill thus far will have to stick together for a few more votes before the Senate votes on approving the foreign assistance package and sending it to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is facing threats from the right to try to oust him if he puts a Ukraine aid bill on the floor.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces launched 45 drones Sunday over Ukraine in a 5 1/2-hour barrage, officials said, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continued the reshuffle of his Cabinet as the war nears its third year.
In a statement, the Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 40 of the Iranian-made Shahed drones over nine regions, including on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv.
The attack targeted agricultural facilities and coastal infrastructure, officials for Ukraine's southern defense forces wrote on Telegram. They said a strike in the Mykolaiv region injured one person, sparking a fire and damaging residential buildings.
Another person was injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region when a blaze broke out from a destroyed drone's falling debris, an official said.
Border police in Moldova said fragments of a "Shahed-type drone" from Friday were found near the southern town of Etulia close to the border with Ukraine, but the debris posed no danger to communities nearby.
Moldovan President Maia Sandu responded to the incident by saying in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that "Russia's war on Ukraine hits close to home in Moldova -- again. ... Support for Ukraine must continue."
The strikes come as Zelenskyy continues his shakeup of military commanders in a bid to keep up momentum against attacking Russian forces.
Kyiv announced Sunday that former deputy defense minister Lt. Gen. Alexander Pavlyuk would become the new commander of its ground forces. The post was previously held by Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, who was named Thursday as the replacement for Ukraine's outgoing military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi.
New presidential decrees also named Yurii Sodol, the former head of Ukraine's marine corps, as the new commander of Ukraine's combined forces; Brig. Gen. Ihor Skibiuk as commander of Ukraine's air assault forces; and Maj. Gen. Ihor Plahuta as commander of territorial defense forces.
Syrskyi has signaled that his immediate goals include improving troop rotation at the front lines and harnessing the power of new technology as Kyiv's forces are largely on the defensive.
Ukraine's military intelligence service said Sunday that attacking Russian forces had been found using Starlink terminals to aid their attack. Starlink terminals, which use satellites run by Elon Musk's company SpaceX to provide high-speed communications, have been vital in giving Ukraine's military an edge over invading Russian troops. SpaceX released a statement on social media Thursday saying it did not "do business of any kind with the Russian government or its military."
Western tech components have regularly been found among Russia's arsenal as Moscow has become more skilled at evading sanctions, often importing goods via third countries.

Full text: President Vladimir Putin of Russia kept returning to one message over and over in his meandering, two-​hour interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson: Russia wants to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine -- albeit on the Kremlin's terms.
That message seemed aimed at the American right and Republicans in Congress, with an eye to undermining support for aid to Ukraine. If so, the day after the long-anticipated interview, it seemed lost in the muddle.
The Russian leader's discursive historical diatribes, delving into everything from the Rurik dynasty to the Golden Horde, dominated commentary about the interview online and overshadowed the message he intended to deliver.
In Russia on Friday, experts and even some of Putin's allies were also puzzling over why he gave short shrift to his main ideological commonality with Carlson's followers: opposition to LGBTQ rights and other liberal social causes.
Margarita Simonyan, head of the Russian state broadcaster, RT, lamented that Putin neglected to market Russia as a "safe haven for people who are not ready to send their children to be raised by LGBT people."
"This is the only thing on which Russia can and should now build an ideology externally," Simonyan said, blaming Carlson for not asking the right questions. "Just as the USSR once built it on the ideas of social equality."
Instead, Putin spent much of the interview subjecting a baffled Carlson to an irredentist teach-in on 1,000 years of Eastern European history, leaving the former Fox News host, by his own admission, "shocked."
The result was a sense that the Russian leader missed a chance.
"I assume that he just didn't try very hard," Grigorii Golosov, a professor of political science at the European University at St. Petersburg, said in a phone interview. "If his goal was really to explain himself -- and that's what it seems to have been -- then it is unlikely that he reached that goal."
Golosov said that Putin's main tactical aim was to try to compel the West to make a favorable deal to end the war -- one that would cement Russia's control of the Ukrainian territory it has already captured and, perhaps, lead to a more Russia-friendly government in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.
"Putin feels that this is the very best moment to force the West into what he believes is the natural way out of this situation," Golosov said. "And that means direct talks with Russia without the participation of Ukraine about how to end the conflict on Russia's terms."
Between the historical diatribes, that intent was evident.
Putin presented negotiations, on his terms, as a way out, now that the West had finally realized Russia was not going to suffer a "strategic defeat" on the battlefield in Ukraine.
At another point, he asked, "Wouldn't it be better to come to an agreement with Russia?"
In Ukraine, where officials have been deeply skeptical of Putin's signaling of a desire for talks in recent months -- as Russian missile barrages streak into cities across the country -- the suggestion was dismissed as unserious.
"Carlson's interview with Putin is a two-hour marathon of delusions and fakes," the Center for Strategic Communications, a Ukrainian government organization, said in a statement.
In the interview, Putin brought the message of a possible settlement directly to "the masses of (former President Donald) Trump's electorate" on X, Maria Zolkina, a political analyst, wrote in a post on Facebook, suggesting it was aimed at swaying American policies on Ukraine by resonating with Republicans opposed to aid.
The argument that the war could end through concessions to Russia, she said, "fits right in with Trump's narrative."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A sweeping emergency aid bill for Ukraine and Israel inched ahead in the Senate on Thursday, providing glimmers of hope for the measure after a series of setbacks.
But hurdles remained as Republicans slow-walked progress, demanding changes and feuding internally over whether to back it.
In a bipartisan show of support, the Senate voted 67-32 to advance the bill, with 17 Republicans joining Democrats to move it forward. The legislation would provide $60.1 billion for Ukraine, $14.1 billion for Israel and $10 billion in humanitarian aid for civilians in global conflicts. But many Republicans were still withholding their backing as they demanded changes to the package, and many others opposed it outright.
"We hope to reach an agreement with our Republican colleagues on amendments," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader. "We are going to keep working on this bill until the job is done."
Some predicted that Senate consideration could still take days, and leaders in both parties expected to spend the weekend working through the remaining disputes. If it survives and can pass, the legislation still faces steep challenges in the House, where a large group of Republicans is vehemently opposed. Still, proponents of the measure said Thursday's action suggested that the aid package, which has been stalled for months, might finally have a path toward approval in Congress.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the vote "a very important first step to continue support for Ukraine's victory and increase our shared security," in a social media post in which he wrote: "This is a bad day for Putin, and a good day for democracies."
Among other things, Senate Republicans are insisting on the opportunity to add border restrictions to the package -- despite having voted Wednesday to block a version of the legislation that included a bipartisan package of border restrictions. They spent much of Thursday haggling over which changes to seek.
The sluggish action was the latest manifestation of discord that has roiled the GOP and imperiled the emergency national security spending bill. Republicans have clashed over how to address international crises without angering the leader of their party and its likely presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.
Senate Republicans had initially signaled early Wednesday that they were likely to support moving a clean foreign aid bill without border provisions forward as long as they had opportunities to propose changes, terms that Schumer agreed to in principle. Leaders on both sides were optimistic that they would have enough backing to speedily advance the measure.
But their optimism soon gave way to frustration, as Republicans devolved into a familiar crouch, torn between rival factions and utterly unable to make a decision about how to proceed. They spent much of Wednesday afternoon and evening squabbling over which amendments to insist on -- and some argued privately they should not allow the bill to move forward at all.
Republican senators are split, with some staunchly supportive of sending a fresh infusion of military aid to help Ukraine fight off a Russian invasion, and those on the right deeply opposed to doing so. And some Republicans who back the aid are nonetheless concerned that doing so without exacting a price from Democrats would compromise them politically in an election year, given Trump's opposition to backing Ukraine's war effort.
"Failing to take this up is exactly what Putin hopes happens this week, and I'm going to do everything I can to prevent it," said one of them, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.
But other Republicans who have championed aid to Ukraine continued to withhold their support. They included Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma. Lankford spent the past four months negotiating a bipartisan deal to pair Ukraine funding with border security measures, a trade-off Republicans had demanded, only to have it rejected by Republicans on Wednesday.
Democrats also have a wish list of changes. Nearly 20 Democratic senators, most of them from the left wing of the party, have signed on to a proposal that would require recipients of security aid to use weapons in accordance with U.S. law, international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict -- and not hamper efforts to send humanitarian aid to civilians. While not specifically mentioning Israel, it was inspired by senators' concerns about that country's bombardment of the Gaza Strip running afoul of international law.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- When Russian troops and tanks invaded Ukraine in February 2022, tens of thousands of Ukrainians rushed to serve in the army in a surge of patriotic fervor. The influx of fighters who dutifully answered their draft notices or enlisted as volunteers helped to repel Russia's initial assault and thwart the Kremlin's plans to decapitate the Ukrainian government.
But after nearly two years of bloody fighting, and with Ukraine again in need of fresh troops to fend off a new Russian push, military leaders can no longer rely solely on enthusiasm. More men are avoiding military service, while calls to demobilize exhausted front-line soldiers have grown.
The change in mood has been particularly evident in the heated debates over a new mobilization bill that could lead to drafting up to 500,000 troops. The bill was introduced in parliament last month -- only to be quickly withdrawn for revision.
The bill has catalyzed discontent in Ukrainian society about the army recruitment process, which has been denounced as riddled with corruption and increasingly aggressive. Many lawmakers have said that some of its provisions, like banning draft dodgers from buying real estate, could violate human rights.
The biggest sticking point concerns the highly delicate issue of mass mobilization. Measures that would make conscription easier have been seen by experts as paving the way for a large-scale draft, of the kind several military officials have recently said is needed to make up for losses on the battlefield and withstand another year of fierce fighting. Many in Ukraine fear that such measures could stir up social tensions.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appeared unwilling to take responsibility for instituting a major draft, instead asking his government and the army to come up with more arguments supporting this move.
"I haven't seen clear-enough details to say that we need to mobilize half a million" people, he said in a recent interview with Channel 4, a British broadcaster.
The military has suggested that mass mobilization is an issue for the civilian government, a response that could exacerbate brewing tensions between Zelenskyy and his top commander, Valery Zaluzhny. Zelenskyy rebuked Zaluzhny in the fall, after he said the war had reached a stalemate.
"It's a hot potato," said Petro Burkovsky, the head of the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Ukrainian think tank.
"The political leadership decided to avoid the issue of mobilization" for most of the war, Burkovsky said. But with troops depleted after two years, ignoring it is not sustainable, "and right now, someone has to be politically responsible."
The challenge of mustering enough soldiers is one of many facing Ukraine as foreign military and financial aid becomes harder to come by, threatening to weaken Kyiv's ability to hold the front line and support its economy.
The need to replenish the Ukrainian armed forces has been evident for months. While Kyiv has kept its casualty count secret, U.S. officials this summer put the number at nearly 70,000 killed and 100,000 to 120,000 wounded.
Russia's casualties, the U.S. officials said, were nearly twice that -- the result of sending waves of troops in bloody assaults to capture cities, regardless of the human cost. But Russia has a much larger population, and it has swelled its ranks with tens of thousands of prisoners.
By contrast, Ukraine's efforts to rebuild its forces have lagged.
Soldiers at the front said they had noticed a steady decline in the quality of recruits. Many are older, nursing injuries from years ago and unmotivated to fight.
More men are also trying to avoid the draft, escaping the country or hiding at home. Desertion, said one Ukrainian soldier stationed in the east, is also becoming an issue.
That has prompted military recruiters to shift to more aggressive tactics, forcing men into conscription offices, detaining them, sometimes illegally, and forcing them to enlist. Lawyers and activists have spoken out, but there is little sign of change.
Many Ukrainians have likened recruiters to "people snatchers."
Zaluzhny said in an essay in November that the recruitment process needed to be reviewed "to build up our reserves." But he and other officials have offered little alternative to a large-scale mobilization.
Zelenskyy has said his army chiefs have asked him to mobilize 450,000 to 500,000 men. "This is a significant number," he said last month, adding that a plan had to be drawn up before he could decide.
Experts say that is the main purpose of the mobilization bill, which does not specify how many troops should be added. It would lower the conscription age to 25 from 27, limit deferments over minor disabilities, and restrict the ability of draft dodgers to obtain a loan or buy property. It also gives local authorities greater responsibility for conscription.
But many lawmakers, including from Zelenskyy's party, have raised concerns at measures such as those affecting the disabled and draft dodgers. They also say relying on local governments may exacerbate problems. Regional recruitment centers have been plagued by corruption, with officers taking bribes to let men evade being drafted.
"All together, that made this bill unacceptable in its form," said Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of parliament in the opposition European Solidarity party.
After several days of debate this month, lawmakers sent the bill back for revision.
"I clearly understand that the task of the military is to achieve success on the front," Ruslan Stefanchuk, the speaker of parliament, told the Ukrainian news media recently. "However, we need to work together to regulate such important and sensitive processes as mobilization."
Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's defense minister, said the government is already working on revisions. He expressed frustration at the lawmakers' decision, saying mobilization had been "politicized and stalled."
Honcharenko said a broader debate is needed on Ukraine's military strategy. No one has clearly explained why it is now necessary to conscript up to 500,000 people, he said, which has left civilians confused.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Employees from a Ukrainian arms firm conspired with defense ministry officials to embezzle almost $40 million earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells for the war with Russia, Ukraine's security service reported.
The SBU said late Saturday that five people have been charged, with one person detained while trying to cross the Ukraine border. If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison.
The investigation comes as Kyiv attempts to clamp down on corruption in a bid to speed its membership in the European Union and NATO. Officials from both blocs have demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join them.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected on an anti-corruption platform in 2019, long before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The president and his aides have portrayed the recent firings of top officials, notably that of Ivan Bakanov, former head of the State Security Service, in July 2022, as proof of their efforts to crack down on graft.
Security officials say the current investigation dates to August 2022, when officials signed a contract for artillery shells worth $39.6 million with arms firm Lviv Arsenal.
After receiving payment, company employees were supposed to transfer the money to a business registered abroad, which would then deliver the ammunition to Ukraine.
However, the goods were never delivered and the money was instead sent to various accounts in Ukraine and the Balkans, investigators said.
Ukraine's prosecutor general says the money has since been seized and will be returned to the country's defense budget.
Fatal attack at church: Two masked assailants attacked a Roman Catholic church in Istanbul during a Sunday Mass, killing one person, Turkish officials said.
The armed assailants attacked the Santa Maria Church in the Sariyer district at 11:40 a.m., Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said in a statement on X. He didn't specify what kind of weapons were used or whether anyone was wounded.
Turkish authorities didn't formally identify the victim, but local media said the person killed had the initials C.T. and was 52 years old.
Hours later, Yerlikaya announced that two men -- one from Tajikistan, the other from Russia -- he described as members of Islamic State had been arrested as the suspected attackers.
He also said police raided 30 locations and detained 47 people as part of the investigation.
Turkish authorities instituted a media ban on coverage of the attack.
Nobel laureate freed: An appeals court in Bangladesh granted bail Sunday to Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who had been sentenced to six months in prison for violating the country's labor laws. The court also agreed to hear an appeal against his sentencing.
Yunus pioneered the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, especially women. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work.
The 83-year-old economist and three other officials of Grameen Telecom, which Yunus founded as a nonprofit, were sentenced Jan. 1 to six months in prison, but they were immediately granted 30 days of bail to appeal the verdict and sentence.
Sunday's court decision said the bail would remain effective until a final decision is made on the appeal for the sentencing.
Defense lawyer Abdullah Al Mamun said the first hearing on the appeal was scheduled for March 3.
Yunus' supporters said the case is politically motivated, a charge the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was elected for a fourth straight term this month, has denied.
Attack on 'Mona Lisa': Two climate activists hurled soup Sunday at the glass protecting the "Mona Lisa" at the Louvre Museum in Paris and shouted slogans advocating for a sustainable food system.
In a video posted on social media, two women with "FOOD RIPOSTE" written on their T-shirts could be seen passing under a security barrier to get closer to the painting and throwing soup at the glass protecting Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece.
"What's the most important thing?" they shouted. "Art or right to a healthy and sustainable food? Our farming system is sick. Our farmers are dying at work."
The Louvre employees could then be seen putting black panels in front of the painting and asking visitors to evacuate the room.
Paris police said two people were arrested.
On its website, the Food Riposte group said the French government is breaking its climate commitments and called for the equivalent of the country's state-sponsored health care system to be put in place to give people better access to healthy food while providing farmers a decent income.
Angry French farmers have been using their tractors for days to set up road blockades and slow traffic across France to seek better compensation for their produce, less red tape and protection against cheap imports. They also dumped stinky agricultural waste at the gates of government offices.
Bullfighting in Mexico: Bullfights were set to return Sunday to Mexico City after the country's highest court temporarily revoked a local ruling that sided with human rights defenders and suspended the events for more than a year and a half.
The resumption of bullfights in the Plaza Mexico arena, the largest of its kind in the world, has raised expectations in the face of a lengthy legal battle between enthusiasts and opponents, who say the practice violates animal welfare and affects people's rights to a healthy environment.
Bullfighting is still allowed in much of Mexico. In the capital, the legal fight for its future is full of twists and turns.
In May 2022, a local court ordered an end to bullfighting activities at Plaza Mexico in response to an injunction presented by the civil organization Justicia Justa, which defends human rights. But the activities were set to resume Sunday because the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the suspension in December while the merits of the case are discussed and a decision is reached on whether bullfights affect animal welfare.
Another civil organization filed an appeal Friday on animal welfare grounds in a last-ditch effort to prevent the activity from resuming. A ruling was not expected before Sunday's event.
As an alternative to the court system, some local organizations called for a march in the Zócalo, or main plaza, in central Mexico City, as well as protests around Plaza Mexico.
Ranchers, fans and businessmen say bullfighting generates about $400 million a year in Mexico, and the ban affects their rights and jobs. The National Association of Fighting Bull Breeders in Mexico says bullfighting is responsible for 80,000 direct jobs and 146,000 indirect jobs.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Officials in Ukraine said Russia has provided no credible evidence to back its claims that Ukrainian forces shot down a military transport plane that Moscow says was carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war who were to be swapped for Russian POWs.
The Ukrainian agency that deals with prisoner exchanges said late Friday that Russian officials had "with great delay" provided it with a list of the 65 Ukrainians who Moscow said had died in the plane crash in Russia's Belgorod region Wednesday.
Ukraine's Coordination Staff for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said relatives of the named POWs were unable to identify their loved ones in crash site photos provided by Russian authorities. The agency's update cited Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Lt. Col. Kyrylo Budanov, as saying that Kyiv had no verifiable information about who was on the plane.
The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that missiles fired from across the border brought down the transport plane that it said was taking the POWs back to Ukraine. Local authorities in Belgorod, which borders Ukraine, said the crash killed all 74 people on board, including six crew members and three Russian servicemen.
"We currently don't have evidence that there could have been that many people aboard the aircraft. Russian propaganda's claim that the IL-76 aircraft was transporting 65 Ukrainian POWs for a prisoner swap continues to raise a lot of questions," Budanov said.
Kyiv has neither confirmed nor denied that its forces downed a Russian military transport plane that day, and Russia's claim that the crash killed Ukrainian POWs couldn't be independently verified. Earlier Friday, Mykola Oleshchuk, Ukraine's air force commander, described Moscow's assertion as "rampant Russian propaganda."
Ukrainian officials confirmed last week that a prisoner swap was due to happen Wednesday, but said it was called off. They said Moscow didn't ask for any specific stretch of airspace to be kept safe for a certain length of time, as it has for past prisoner exchanges.
An International Committee of the Red Cross spokesperson in Ukraine urged Russia on Friday night to return the bodies of any POWs who might have died in the plane crash.
While Ukraine and Russia regularly exchange the bodies of dead soldiers, each trade has required considerable preparation, Red Cross media relations officer Oleksandr Vlasenko told U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for an international investigation into the crash. Russia has sole access to the crash site.
Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged Friday to make the findings of Moscow's crash investigation public. In his first public remarks about the crash, he offered no details to support the allegation that Kyiv was to blame, but said the plane's flight recorders had been found.
"There are black boxes, everything will now be collected and shown," Putin said.

NKorea's latest missiles a concern in Ukraine: Russia to use them to tax air defenses, the West forecasts

Full text: BERLIN -- When Russia turned to Kim Jong Un of North Korea to help it through its war with Ukraine, it came with a big shopping list that included 1 million rounds of artillery to shoot at Ukrainian troops dug into trenches across the south and east, and dozens of North Korea's newest, barely tested missiles.
Now those weapons are beginning to show up, deeply worrying U.S. and European officials who say they fear the North's ammunition could prove important on the battlefield at a huge moment of vulnerability for Ukraine.
While many of the North Korean artillery rounds are proving to be duds -- some appear to have been manufactured decades ago -- they are giving the Russians something to fire at Ukrainian forces, who are rationing their own dwindling supply. European nations promised Ukraine a huge resupply, but for now seem to have been able to scrounge up only 300,000 or so artillery shells.
But it is the missiles that raise the most concern, from the Pentagon to NATO's headquarters in Brussels. In interviews, a range of officials said they fear the Russians hope to use missiles to overwhelm Western air defenses. While so far the number of missiles transferred is small, likely fewer than 50, U.S. and European officials believe there could be far more to come.
And unlike with the artillery rounds, North Korea is not shipping its older equipment. An analysis by Conflict Armament Research, an organization that has documented the arms used in Russia's war in Ukraine, showed the missiles being provided to Russia are more recent in their design. And U.S. officials say the missiles are proving as accurate as Russia's home-built equipment. Three barrages of North Korean-made missiles targeted Ukrainian positions around the new year, U.S. officials say, and they believe more were used on the battlefield Sunday.
Officials and analysts in South Korea say the Ukraine war is giving the North something it desperately needs: a testing ground to see how its new missile arsenal, designed for a conflict with South Korea and the United States, fares against Western-designed air defenses.
The turn to North Korea, as the war approaches its second anniversary, reflects Russia's own struggle to keep up with the pace at which both sides are burning through their stocks of arms. Russia has also turned to Iran for drones and is reportedly seeking Iranian missiles as well -- though there is no evidence it has yet gotten them.
The bulk of the missiles being fired at Ukraine are still produced in Russia. But if North Korea steps up its supply, Ukraine could be forced to shoot off precious rounds of air defenses, a development that could be devastating to Ukraine if additional military funding is not approved by Congress, U.S. officials said. The imports have especially alarmed leading members of NATO, who have declined to speak publicly but say they worry the infusion of the North Korean arms could prove particularly troublesome at a time when Ukraine is uncertain about when, or from whom, it will receive its next supplies.
For now, the air defenses are holding. Last week, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. commander in Europe, told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that he believed the Ukrainian military had enough air defenses to survive the winter, two senior U.S. officials said.
But if North Korea increases its missile shipments, and Congress fails to pass additional aid, that calculation could change.
Russia has already obtained several dozen North Korean missiles and is hoping to acquire more.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia said he planned to visit North Korea soon, according to North Korean state media. Russia has fired North Korean missiles against Ukraine at least three times since late December, including attacks on Dec. 30, Jan. 2 and Jan. 6.
The missiles come on top of a steady stream of artillery shells, as many as 1 million rounds, that North Korea has agreed to ship to Russia. But the quality of those rounds is poor. Some have exploded inside Russian guns, and many of the rest have fallen harmlessly in underpopulated areas.
Quantity itself, however, matters on the battlefield. Last summer, Ukraine was firing as many as 7,000 artillery shells a day and had managed to damage Russia's ammunition supplies to the point that Russia was firing about 5,000 rounds a day, according to U.S. and other Western analysts. Now the Ukrainians are struggling to fire 2,000 rounds daily, while Russian artillery, augmented by the North Korean shells, is reaching about 10,000 a day, analysts said.
Still, U.S. officials are far more worried about North Korean missiles.
After the first barrage, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, began working on an intensified effort to gather international support condemning the weapons transfer and trying to increase pressure on North Korea to stop providing the missiles.
U.S. officials believe that at times since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, U.S. disclosures of North Korean shipments have caused North Korea to halt or delay further transfers.
The Russian transfers are coming at a critical time in the war in Ukraine, as further U.S. support hangs in the balance, subject to intense political debates on Capitol Hill.
The United States has provided myriad air defense systems and ammunition to Ukraine. And U.S. officials have said those systems -- including Patriot batteries -- have proved capable of blunting the damage of Russian missile attacks.
But U.S. officials said that in order to provide more air defense systems and ammunition, Congress needs to approve an additional aid package.
U.S. officials say Ukrainian air defenses are a critical area of concern. After initial setbacks because of Western sanctions, Russia has rebuilt its industrial capacity and stockpiled missiles. But if Russia can get even more North Korean missiles, it will be able to more easily overcome Ukrainian defenses.
"The Ukrainians continue to get attacked," John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said last week. "They continue to come under artillery shell, air attacks, ballistic and cruise missile, as well as drone attacks from the Russians."
It will be difficult for the United States to stop additional shipments. North Korea has been taking a more belligerent position in recent days. It has declared that it would no longer seek reconciliation with the South, prompting some experts to speculate that the country may be seeking to provoke a new conflict.

Full text: A Russian military transport plane crashed Wednesday in a border region near Ukraine, and Moscow accused Kyiv of shooting it down, saying all 74 people aboard were killed, including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war headed for a swap. Russia offered no evidence and Ukraine didn't immediately confirm or deny it.
Video of the crash on social media from the Belgorod border region of Russia showed a plane falling from the sky in a snowy, rural area, and a massive ball of fire erupting where it apparently hit the ground.
The Associated Press couldn't confirm who was aboard or other details on what brought the plane down.
Throughout the 700-day war, Russia and Ukraine have traded conflicting accusations, and establishing the facts has often been difficult.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would push for an international investigation of what happened. "It is necessary to establish all the facts, as much as possible, considering that the plane crash occurred on Russian territory -- beyond our control," he said in his nightly address.
"It's obvious Russians are playing with lives of Ukrainian POWs, with feelings of their relatives and emotions of our society," Zelenskyy said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Il-76 transport plane was carrying 65 POWs, a crew of six and three Russian servicemen. Russian radar registered the launch of two missiles from Ukraine's Kharkiv region that borders Belgorod, the statement said.
"We've seen the reports, but we're not in any position to confirm them," U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
Separately, a U.S. official said that it's not clear that there were actually Ukrainian POWs aboard the aircraft that crashed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
Hours after the crash, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine made no mention of the crash in a statement. But it added that Ukraine targets Russian military transport planes believed to be delivering missiles, especially near the border.
The Kharkiv and Belgorod regions have long been a focus of the fighting between the neighbors, including airstrikes with missiles and drones.
The Russian military said that the POWs were being flown to the region for a prisoner swap when the plane was downed at 11:15 a.m. local time.
Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed a swap was due to take place, but said that it had no information about who was on the plane. Moscow didn't ask for specific airspace to be kept safe for a certain length of time, as has happened in past exchanges, it said in a statement.
Russian officials and lawmakers questioned whether there should be further prisoner swaps between Moscow and Kyiv. The most recent one, brokered by the United Arab Emirates, took place this month and was the biggest to date, with 230 Ukrainian POWs returning home and 248 Russians released. It was the first in almost five months and the 49th of the war.
Russia has largely ensured its air dominance during the war against Ukraine's fleet of Soviet-era warplanes. But Russia has suffered a series of crashes that some observers have attributed to a higher number of flights amid the fighting in Ukraine.
At the same time, Kyiv has boasted of shooting down two Russian command and control planes, which would be a major feat for Ukraine if true. Cross-​border attacks on Russia's Belgorod region also have increased, with the deadliest one killing 25 people in December.
Shortly before the crash, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that a "missile alert" had been triggered in the region.

Full text: KHARKIV, Ukraine -- It was the middle of the night in early January when a Russian missile streaked in and exploded in the center of Kharkiv, blasting down walls and shattering windows.
The next day, people went shopping and to work, ate out in restaurants and clogged the streets with traffic jams, almost as if nothing had happened.
But behind the business-as-usual veneer, residents of Kharkiv have been seething. Over the past month, Ukraine's second-largest city has taken the brunt of Russia's missile campaign, which has killed and wounded dozens of people, blown up buildings and unnerved everyone.
It's an almost-daily torment. To vent, Kharkiv's residents have a dedicated outlet: Radio Boiling Over, a new FM station.
"This is Boiling Over in the Morning," Volodymyr Noskov, the host of the morning call-in show, said on a recent broadcast. "What are you boiling over about today?"
In Kharkiv, a sprawling city of universities and factories, coping has taken many forms. Nearly two years into the war, the city is opening schools underground. Psychologists visit strike sites to calm residents. Plywood goes up immediately over blown-out windows.
Amid the carnage, Radio Boiling Over, which went on the air a year ago, is becoming one of the most popular local media outlets. It serves as a megaphone for the fears and frustrations that simmer within a population under near-constant assault.
"Despite all Russia is doing, the city is still living," said Yevhen Streltsov, founder of Radio Boiling Over. But "people are getting tired because their nerves are not made of iron" and they want to complain.
While there are occasional complaints about local bureaucrats and inefficiency, most of the anger is directed at Russia, especially after strikes.
"Burn in hell until the seventh generation. Curse the unwashed Russians," a listener, Tetyana Arshava, wrote on the station's Instagram page after one high-casualty missile attack.
The station broadcasts hourly news updates and talk shows in the morning and evening, with a focus on missile strikes; interviews with soldiers on the front line 100 or so miles east; investigations of Russian war crimes; and, of course, the anger of hundreds of thousands of people forced to worry daily about their safety. The station's name, Radio Nakypilo, can also be translated as Radio Fed Up.
It receives funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, an American nonprofit financed by the U.S. government, and the European Endowment for Democracy, with the mission of covering local news in a community that, even by the standards of Ukraine's battered cities, has endured a harrowing 23 months.
Kharkiv, which is 24 miles from the Russia border, was an early target of invading Russian ground forces and was partly encircled. Of the pre-invasion population of about 2 million, 1.2 million remain today.
Barrages of ballistic missiles fly in anywhere from once a week to daily, arriving so quickly that alarms can provide no more than 40 seconds of warning. Parents rush children into bathtubs, or at the least away from windows.
Over the past three weeks, Russian missiles ravaged two hotels, Kharkiv Palace and Park Hotel; blew out windows in popular restaurants, which quickly reopened; and hit apartment blocks. The predawn strike on the apartment building early this month injured 17 people.
"This is our everyday life," Streltsov said.
Yet despite the mortal threat, ballistic missile strikes have become so common in Kharkiv that Radio Boiling Over does not interrupt its music programming if only one missile has landed, Yevhen said.
Announcers will cut in only for several volleys or a catastrophic strike.
Kharkiv is handicapped because the military's best air-defense systems, including U.S.-provided Patriots, are mostly reserved for the capital, Kyiv. So it endures the regular mayhem that comes with being the closest large city to the Russia border.
"Nobody has this experience anywhere in the world," the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said in an interview. He said people were generally coping well. "There are strikes, yes, but no panic."
Terekhov has been promoting a program of building schools underground to protect them from missiles. The school district has built five in corridors of subway stops, called MetroSchools, and is close to finishing a purpose-built subterranean elementary school for 450 students, with only the soccer field on the surface.
The subway schools are at once an uplifting scene of children, boisterous and happy, finally back among friends, and a post-apocalyptic vision of a world where schools are designed similar to bunkers.
"It's really surrealistic," said Iryna Tarasenko, director of the city's department of education. "This is the reality we live in. These are the conditions."
Radio Boiling Over's mission is to capture that reality and give people an outlet to let off steam, as well as provide useful practical information.
The government gave Radio Boiling Over space on the FM spectrum for two purposes: to report local news and to jam a Russian psychological warfare operation that had been beaming in news on the same frequency. The Russian channel sent eerie, bizarre content intended to unnerve civilians and soldiers, including repeating the phrase "We will kill you."
With the switch to Radio Boiling Over, people started to tune in, Streltsov said. "People listen because we are fast" with news about missile strikes and fighting along the front nearby, he said.
Roman Korobenko, a reporter for the station, said people younger than 40, who came of age after the Soviet breakup, are fed up with Russia. Older residents have mixed feelings, sometimes lamenting that war had come even though Russians and Ukrainians had previously lived in peace.
Some people are annoyed with the constant wail of ambulance sirens, he said. Some are just continually gripped by anxiety.
Mostly, Korobenko said, people are angry. "These days, everybody is boiling over."

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Moscow-installed officials said Ukrainian shelling killed at least 27 people and wounded 25 Sunday at a market in a suburb of Donetsk, a Russian-occupied city in the eastern part of the country.
Among the injured in Tekstilshchik were two children, said Denis Pushilin, the local leader.
Ukrainian officials in Kyiv did not comment on the incident, and the claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press.
Both sides have increasingly relied on longer-range attacks this winter amid largely unchanged positions on the 930-mile front line in the nearly 2-year-old war.
The artillery shells that hit the area had been fired from the area of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west, Pushilin said.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today's shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine," according to a U.N. spokesperson, adding that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed illegally in 2022, months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
Also Sunday, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia's Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said. Local media said the Baltic Sea port, about 100 miles southwest of St. Petersburg, had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek.
In a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company blamed the fire on an "external influence," saying operations at the port were paused.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of the Kingisepp district on the Gulf of Finland where the port is located, said there were no casualties but the area was on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg on Sunday morning but were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. AP could not independently verify the reports.
Russia's Defense Ministry did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing.
Russian officials previously confirmed the downing of a Ukrainian drone on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
In fighting on the front line, Russia's Defense Ministry said Moscow's forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces confirmed the settlement had been occupied but described its capture as temporary.
Ukrainian Ground Forces Command spokesman Volodymyr Fityo said Kyiv's troops had been pulled back to reserve positions from the village, which had a population of about 45 before the start of the war.

Full text: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is worried at the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House, branding Trump's claim that he could stop Ukraine's war with Russia in 24 hours as "very dangerous."
In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News that aired Friday, Zelenskyy invited the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and former president to visit Kyiv, but only if Trump delivers on his promise.
"Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come," Zelenskyy said.
Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not respond to a message seeking comment Saturday.
The Ukrainian leader also voiced concern about the U.S. taking unilateral action that failed to consider Ukraine's perspective, noting the dearth of details about Trump's "peace plan."
Zelenskyy described the former president's rhetoric as "very dangerous" and appeared apprehensive that Trump's idea of a negotiated solution might involve Ukraine making major concessions to Russia.
Trump "is going to make decisions on his own, without ... I'm not even talking about Russia, but without both sides, without us," he said. "If he says this publicly, that's a little scary. I've seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that's really making me a bit stressed."
He added: "Because even if his idea (for ending the war) -- that no one has heard yet -- doesn't work for us, for our people, he will do anything to implement his idea anyway. And this worries me a little."
Trump has repeatedly insisted that he is well positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for nearly two years, saying he has a good relationship with Russian and Ukrainian leaders. Throughout his political career, he has lavished praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine.
At a campaign rally in Georgia just days after Russian tanks moved into Ukraine, Trump described Putin as a "smart" political player and expressed admiration for Russia's swift takeover of a vast, "great piece of land" at the cost of what he suggested were relatively minor sanctions.
The U.S. House of Representatives impeached Trump when he was president, alleging that he pressured Zelenskyy to pursue a politically motivated probe that might hurt Joe Biden's chance to win the 2020 presidential election while withholding $400 million in military aid that Congress approved to help Ukraine confront Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. The Senate acquitted Trump.
Elsewhere, the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog warned Saturday that mines had been replanted around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, just months after a team of international inspectors reported on their removal.

War in Ukraine: Kyiv's forces struggle as supplies, morale both in short supply

Full text: EASTERN UKRAINE -- The Ukrainian soldier stared at the Russian tank. It was destroyed over a year ago in the country's east and now sat far from the front line. He shrugged and cut into its rusted hull with a gas torch.
The soldier was not there for the tank's engine or turret or treads. Those had already been salvaged. He was there for its thick armor. The metal would be cut and strapped as protection to Ukrainian armored personnel carriers defending the embattled town of Avdiivka, about 65 miles away.
The need to cannibalize a destroyed Russian vehicle to help protect Ukraine's dwindling supply of equipment underscores Kyiv's current challenges on the battlefield as it prepares for another year of pitched combat.
"If our international partners moved faster, we would have kicked their ass in the first three or four months so hard that we would have gotten over it already. We'd be sowing fields and raising children," said the soldier, who went by the call sign Jaeger, in keeping with military protocol. "We'd be sending bread to Europe. But it's been two years already."
Ukraine's military prospects are looking bleak. Western military aid is no longer assured at the same levels as years past. Ukraine's summer counteroffensive in the south, where Jaeger was wounded days after it began, is over, having failed to meet any of its objectives.
And now, Russian troops are on the attack, especially in the country's east. The town of Marinka has all but fallen. Avdiivka is being slowly encircled. A push on Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut, is expected. Farther north, outside Kupiansk, the fighting has barely slowed since fall.
Among Ukrainian troops the joke goes like this: "The Russian army is not good or bad. It is just long." The Kremlin has more of everything: more men, ammunition and vehicles. And they are not stopping despite their mounting numbers of wounded and dead.
But the soldiers' joke had another certain truth to it. Neither side has distinguished themselves with tactics that have led to a breakthrough on the battlefield. Instead, it has been a deadly dance of small technological advances on both sides that have yet to turn the tide, leaving a conflict that looks like a modernized version of World War I's Western Front: sheer mass versus mass.
It is that tactic that provides Russia the advantage as it pushes to secure Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, Moscow's primary war aim after its defeat in 2022 around Kharkiv, Kherson and the capital, Kyiv. Russia has a population three times the size of Ukraine's, and its military industrial base is operating at full tilt.
"The Russian advantage at this stage is not decisive, but the war is not a stalemate," said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who recently visited Ukraine. "Depending on what happens this year, particularly with western support for Ukraine, 2024 will likely take one or two trajectories. Ukraine could retake the advantage by 2025, or it could start losing the war without sufficient aid."
For now, Ukraine is in a perilous position. The problems afflicting its military have been exacerbated since the summer. Ukrainian soldiers are exhausted by long stretches of combat and shorter rest periods. The ranks, thinned by mounting casualties, are only being partly replenished, often with older and poorly trained recruits.
One Ukrainian soldier, part of a brigade tasked with holding the line southwest of Avdiivka, pointed to a video he took during training recently. The instructors, trying to stifle their laughs, were forced to hold up a man, who was in his mid-50s, just so he could fire his rifle. The man was crippled from alcoholism, the soldier said, insisting on anonymity to candidly describe a private training episode.
"Three out of 10 soldiers who show up are no better than drunks who fell asleep and woke up in uniform," he said, referring to the new recruits who arrive at his brigade.
Ukraine's recruiting strategy has been plagued by overly aggressive tactics and more widespread attempts to dodge the draft. Efforts to rectify the problem have spawned a political argument between the military and civilian leadership.
Military officials reinforce the need for wider mobilization to win the war, but the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is apprehensive about introducing unpopular changes that could end with a drive to mobilize 500,000 new soldiers. That number, analysts say, takes into account Ukraine's staggering losses and what is probably needed to push back the Russians.
Although Ukrainian casualties remain a closely guarded secret, U.S. officials over the summer estimated deaths and injuries at well over 150,000. Russian forces have also taken huge numbers of casualties, according to those officials, but Russia's forces still managed to repel a concerted Ukrainian counteroffensive and regroup; they're now assaulting in frigid winter conditions.
"We're tired," a Ukrainian platoon commander said, speaking anonymously given the sensitivity of his comments. "We could always use more people."
The shortage of troops is only a part of the problem. The other and more pressing issue is Ukraine's dwindling ammunition reserves as continued Western supplies remain uncertain. Ukrainian commanders now have to ration their ammunition, not knowing whether every new shipment might be their last.
At the end of 2023, members of a Ukrainian artillery crew from the 10th Brigade sat inside a bunker in the country's east. Only when a truck carrying two artillery shells arrived could the crew get to work for the first time in days. They quickly loaded the shells and fired toward Russian soldiers attacking Ukrainian positions 3 miles away.
"Today we had two shells, but some days, we don't have any in these positions," said the crew's commander, who goes by the call sign Monk. "The last time we fired was four days ago, and that was only five shells."
The shortage of ammunition and the shifting battlefield momentum mean the gunners are no longer supporting Ukrainian attacks. Instead, they only fire when Russian troops are storming Ukrainian trenches.
"We can stop them for now, but who knows," Monk said. "Tomorrow or the next day, maybe we can't stop them. It's a really big problem for us."
The United States' suggestion for Ukraine to go on the defensive in 2024 will mean little if Ukraine does not have the ammunition or people to defend what territory it currently holds, analysts have said.
"Our guys are getting pounded heavily," said Bardak, a Ukrainian soldier working alongside Jaeger next to the derelict tank. "It's hot all over now."

Full text: Ukraine suffered its third large-scale aerial barrage of the new year, with the escalation of attacks from Kremlin forces coming at a time harsh weather leaves millions vulnerable to power outages.
Russian military jets fired Kinzhal ballistic missiles and cruise missiles at targets across the country early Saturday, Ukrainian air force command said on Telegram.
Forty missiles and drones of various types were launched nationwide and air defense said it shot down eight missiles.
Another 20 or more "failed to achieve their targets due to active work of jamming," the statement said.
Explosions were heard in the northern region of Chernihiv, the western areas of Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk and Rivne, and in the Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava regions in central Ukraine as air defense was working, according to local authorities.
Russia's defense ministry said in a statement that it had targeted Ukraine's "military-industrial complex" with "major" hypersonic missiles and drone strikes, but offered no additional details.
After months of relatively few airstrikes, Russia ramped up its bombardment campaign just before the new year.
Since then it has fired hundreds of missiles at cities across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv, killing more than 45 and wounding dozens of civilians and damaging houses.
The air campaign coincides with the arrival of much colder weather, leaving millions of Ukrainians at risk from the loss of heat and electricity if power infrastructure is damaged. Temperatures were around 8.6 Fahrenheit in central Ukraine and as low as zero in the east Saturday morning, according to Weather Center.
Russia launched the latest strikes hours after U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a surprise visit to Kyiv to announce a new security commitment and a pledge of $3.2 billion in military aid next year.
Sunak and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed a 10-year security cooperation agreement as Ukraine seeks to repel Russian forces that invaded almost two years ago.
Separately, Kyiv said preliminary evidence showed Moscow's forces likely used missiles provided by North Korea in the Jan. 2 attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city.
South Korea's defense minister said Thursday that Pyongyang is looking to step up military cooperation with Russia by sending new types of tactical guided missiles in hopes of securing substantial aid to keep its economy afloat.

Full text: ZAPORIZHZHIA REGION, Ukraine -- Under the cover of darkness, leaning forward under the weight of packs and rifles, a squad of soldiers walked along a muddy lane and slipped into a village house.
They were Ukrainian infantrymen of the 117th Separate Mechanized Brigade, assembling for a last briefing and roll call several miles from Russia positions before heading to the trenches on the front line. Stolid men in helmets and rubber boots, they listened in silence as an intelligence officer briefed them on a new route to their positions.
"Morale is all right," said the deputy battalion commander, who uses the call sign Shira, standing nearby to see the men off. "But physically we are exhausted."
Ukrainian troops along most of the 600-mile front line are officially in defensive mode. Only in the southern region of Kherson are they still on the offensive in a tough assault across the Dnieper River.
But the fighting has not eased, and Russian forces are now on the offensive.
The capture of the town of Robotyne in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region was as far as Ukrainian troops managed to advance in their summer counteroffensive. No breakthrough occurred. Now, in the trenches around Robotyne, Russian units are attacking daily. Ukrainian troops try to counterattack immediately if they lose ground, commanders said.
"It is something like a game of Ping-Pong," said a Ukrainian National Guard platoon commander who uses the call sign Planshet, meaning "tablet." "There is a portion of 100 to 200 meters of ground always being taken and retaken," he said.
Indeed, Ukrainian soldiers and commanders interviewed in recent weeks along a broad stretch of the central and eastern front said that Russian attacks were so intense that operating near the front line has never been so dangerous.
Russia has in recent days turned its focus to bombing Ukraine's big cities to wear down civilians; for weeks its ground forces have been mounting attacks to claw back territory lost last summer and to seize long-prized Ukrainian redoubts along the eastern front.
Well accustomed to Russian artillery fire, soldiers said that since March they had suffered the additional devastating power of glide bombs, half-ton explosives unleashed from planes that smash through underground bunkers.
"They would send them two by two by two, eight in an hour," said a 27-year-old soldier known as Kit, of the 14th Chervona Kalyna National Guard Brigade. Like others interviewed, Kit identified himself by his call sign, according to military protocol. "It sounds like a jet coming down on you," he said, "like hell's gate."
The destruction wrought by glide bombs is visible in towns and villages near the front line. The town of Orikhiv, about 12 miles north of Robotyne, once served as a command center for the counteroffensive. Now it is an empty shell, the main street deserted, the school and other buildings split asunder by massive bomb craters.
Soldiers moved cautiously in the area, mostly living in basements and staying undercover, out of sight.
That is because the latest menace is Russia's use of FPV kamikaze drones, which has forced Ukrainian soldiers largely to abandon vehicles in front-line areas and operate on foot.
A cheap commercial drone, the FPV -- for first-person view -- has become the latest weapon of the moment in the Ukrainian war. It can fly as fast as a car, carries a lethal load of explosives and is guided to its target by a soldier sitting in a bunker several miles away.
Both the Russian and Ukrainian armies are using them to hunt and attack targets because they cut out the delay of relaying back coordinates and requesting artillery strikes. Ukrainian soldiers said they often use the drones instead of artillery because shells were increasingly in short supply and the drones are a cheap, quick weapon for attacks on nearby Russian vehicles, bunkers and infantry.
Military units from both sides post videos online of their successful strikes, which end with a scrambled black screen at the moment of detonation.
Only one in several drones hits its target, and many are lost to jamming and other interference, soldiers said.
Because of FPV drones, defending and supplying the front line have become increasingly risky.
"It is extremely dangerous to go by car," said a Ukrainian National Guardsman, who uses the call sign Varvar. Men of his unit said that since September they had been leaving their armored vehicles and walking 6 miles to positions.
The men of the 117th Brigade, who were deploying to the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region on a recent night, faced a 4-mile hike through rain and mud, the intelligence commander said. If they were wounded and captured, Russian troops would execute them, he warned them.
Ukrainian units are dealing out the same treatment with FPV drones on Russian lines and say they were the first to start using drones to attack targets. But the Russians have copied the tactic and flooded front-line areas with drones in recent weeks, to lethal effect, Ukrainian soldiers and commanders said.
The toll is heavy for all units along the front. Almost everyone has been wounded or survived a narrow escape, soldiers said.
Yet many remain optimistic. Farther east in the Donetsk region, Maj. Serhii Betz, a battalion commander of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, set out before dawn on a recent day, driving down muddy roads rutted with ice to check on his drone units close to the front line.
The teams work underground, in bunkers lined with tree trunks and covered with earth. On a computer monitor, the commander switched on a livestream drone feed from a neighboring brigade where a battle was unfolding.
"Russian tanks entering the village," a commander said over a walkie-talkie. "Is everything ready?" the major asked the drone team. "Let's help our brothers."
The newly deployed team, fresh from training, fiddled with wiring and switches to get an FPV airborne over the Russians' positions for their first strike. They were too slow, and their first two flights crashed, downed by Russian electronic jamming.
But the major was satisfied. "We are developing," he said.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Since the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, the people of Ukraine have had access to a single source of television news -- an all-day broadcast packed with footage of Ukrainian tanks blasting Russian positions, medics operating near the front line and political leaders rallying support abroad.
The show, Telemarathon United News, has been a major tool of Ukraine's information war, praised by the government officials who regularly appear on it for its role in countering Russian disinformation and maintaining morale.
"It's a weapon," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said last January of the program, which is jointly produced and broadcast 24/7 by the country's biggest television channels.
But after nearly two years of war, Ukrainians have grown weary of Telemarathon. What was once seen as a crucial tool for holding the country together is now increasingly derided as little more than a mouthpiece for the government.
Viewers have complained that the program often paints too rosy a picture of the war, hiding worrying developments on the front line and the West's eroding support for Ukraine -- and ultimately failing to prepare citizens for a long war.
Over time, viewership and trust in Telemarathon have plummeted, which experts see as a sign of wider popular disenchantment with the government, as victory on the battlefield becomes elusive. Many viewers instead spend their time watching popular reality shows and entertainment programs.
"Everyone is fed up with this picture that says, 'We're winning, everyone likes us and gives us money,' " said Oksana Romaniuk, head of the Kyiv-based Institute of Mass Information, a media monitoring organization. "It's state propaganda."
Launched shortly after Russia invaded, Telemarathon includes six networks representing around 60% of Ukraine's total prewar audience. Each network is given multiple-hour slots to fill with news and commentary, which are then broadcast by all participants on their news channels.
The program was officially enacted by presidential decree and about 40% of its funding comes from the government, according to Oleksandr Bogutsky, the CEO of StarLight Media, a major media group participating in the project.
But how much control Ukrainian authorities have over Telemarathon's editorial line remains unclear.
At the beginning of the war, a majority of Ukrainians saw the project as vital. As Russian troops closed in on Ukrainian cities and villages, Telemarathon updated viewers about the fighting, advising them on where to find shelter and when to evacuate.
"It was lifesaving content," said Khrystyna Havryliuk, head of news at Suspilne, Ukraine's public broadcaster, which participates in Telemarathon.
The show also lifted people's spirits at a critical time, broadcasting Zelenskyy's inspirational messages into millions of households. "The mood it gave people, the spirit, the hope," Romaniuk said. "It was really impressive."
In March 2022, the program accounted for 40% of Ukraine's total viewership, said Svitlana Ostapa, deputy chief editor of Detector Media, a Ukrainian media watchdog.
Over the months, Telemarathon settled into a well-oiled, round-the-clock newscast, with each channel filling its time slots with reports from the front line, interviews with commanders and discussions with government officials.
That's when ratings started to drop.
By the end of 2022, viewership had shrunk to 14% of the television audience, Ostapa said. Today, it is down to 10%.
Many viewers said that as the threat of a Russian takeover receded, the program's patriotic overtones became increasingly exaggerated.
"They portray events in Ukraine as if everything is fine, as if victory is just around the corner," said Bohdan Chupryna, 20, on a recent evening in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.
Like other Ukrainians, Chupryna said the coverage of Ukraine's counteroffensive this summer was overly optimistic, giving the impression that the military would quickly push through enemy lines.
The counteroffensive faced setbacks from the start and eventually mostly failed.
Ihor Kulias, a media expert monitoring Telemarathon for Detector Media, said that, for most of 2023, the show's participants used language that emphasized "the effectiveness and skill of the Ukrainian forces," while Russian forces were "described as being in a state of panic, experiencing significant losses and surrendering en masse."
It was "a completely different reality" from the actual situation on the ground, Kulias said.
Olena Frolyak, a Ukrainian TV host who works for StarLight Media, denied that the program looked at the situation through "rose-colored glasses."
But she added that bombings and front-line developments are not reported until the government communicates about them. "We have to wait for the official position," she said.
Kulias said some channels had adopted a form of "self-censorship" in their coverage.
He added, however, that Suspilne is a rare example of a channel that has largely maintained an independent editorial line, inviting critics of Zelenskyy as guests and challenging official statements.
Still, the number of Ukrainians who say they trust Telemarathon has dropped sharply over time, from 69% in May 2022 to 43% last month, according to a recent poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
Many critics say Telemarathon is now doing more harm than good.
"It has a dangerous side, it creates an optimistic view of the situation and then leads to disappointment," said Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, the head of the Ukrainian parliament's committee on freedom of speech, who publicly questioned the news broadcast's effectiveness last month.
Yurchyshyn and media experts said they feared the program had blinded people to the fact that the war would drag on and require more sacrifice. Ukraine is currently struggling to recruit soldiers and there is mounting criticism that people living far from the front lines are starting to forget about the conflict.
"We need solid, balanced information that our society can analyze and from which people can make decisions," Yurchyshyn said.

Full text: Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war Wednesday in the biggest single release of captives since Russia's full-scale invasion began.
Ukrainian authorities said 230 Ukrainian prisoners of war returned home in the first exchange in almost five months. Russia's Defense Ministry said 248 Russian servicemen have been freed under the deal sponsored by the United Arab Emirates.
The UAE's Foreign Ministry attributed the successful swap to the "strong friendly relations between the UAE and both the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine, which were supported by sustained calls at the highest levels."
The UAE has maintained close economic ties with Moscow despite Western sanctions and pressure on Russia since it launched its invasion in February 2022.
Ukraine's human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said it was the 49th prisoner exchange during the war.
Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some of those who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine's Snake Island and the city of Mariupol.
Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange.
Also Wednesday, Russia said it shot down 12 missiles fired at one of its southern regions bordering Ukraine, as Kyiv's forces seek to embarrass the Kremlin and puncture President Vladimir Putin's argument that life is going on as normal despite the fighting.
The Russian side of the frontier has come under increasingly frequent attack. Lately, as Russia fired missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, Kyiv's troops have aimed rockets at Belgorod's regional capital, which is about 60 miles north of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city.

Full text: Nearly two years ago, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine unified European nations, reinvigorated the trans-Atlantic alliance and forged a spirit of rare bipartisanship in Washington. Now that resolve is fraying. President Joe Biden's administration and the European Union are struggling to deliver aid for Ukraine's military and budget, with even some of the country's staunchest supporters expressing doubts about its battlefield prospects and calling for negotiations to end the war.
This frustration is perhaps understandable, but it's misguided. It ignores the enormous sacrifices Ukraine's people have made to defend their freedom and push back against Russian aggression -- and underestimates the ability of Ukraine's military to regain the advantage, if given sufficient weaponry. Abandoning the war effort now would wreck the West's credibility and ultimately endanger the democracies supporting Ukraine's defense as much as Ukraine itself.
It's true that Ukraine's forces failed to advance this year as much as leaders inside and outside the country had hoped for. Russia's defensive capabilities and willingness to absorb huge casualties have proved formidable. And while there is much finger-pointing between Ukraine and the West about tactics and decision-making, the supply of weaponry was too little and too late to match the ambitions of the counteroffensive.
Acknowledging these shortcomings is very different from defeatism. The answer isn't to do less. Putin shows no interest in negotiations or any history of abiding by agreements he's made. In this war of attrition, the West must adapt its response to provide more sustainable support over the long term.
Meanwhile, the West should tighten sanctions against Russia and build better enforcement mechanisms to strengthen the price cap on Russian oil and block the Kremlin's ability to import dual-use technologies.
It's impossible to predict when and how the war will end. But defeat would carry steep strategic costs, damage global food and energy security, and embolden Putin to go further. However daunting the challenges faced by Ukraine and its partners in the year ahead, failure isn't an option.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia launched a record 90 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine during the early hours of the new year, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country would "intensify" its attacks on its neighbor.
Speaking during a New Year's Day visit to a military hospital, Putin said Ukraine could expect more such strikes after shelling of the Russian border city of Belgorod that killed more than two dozen people and wounded more than 100 others.
"They want to intimidate us and create uncertainty within our country. We will intensify strikes. Not a single crime against our civilian population will go unpunished," the Russian leader said, describing the barrage of Belgorod as a "terrorist act."
Putin added Russia doesn't want to fight "endlessly" in Ukraine but won't give up its positions and is ready for peace only on its own terms.
He said he's satisfied with the Russian army's performance in Ukraine as it's now holding the strategic initiative on the front, while the opponent is "gradually deflating."
Russia is currently occupying about a fifth of Ukraine's territory.
"We also want to end the conflict, and as soon as possible" -- but "only on our terms," Putin said.
The Russian leader didn't specify what conditions must be met for peace.
Russia has blamed Ukraine for Saturday's attack, which was one of the deadliest to take place on Russian soil since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started more than 22 months ago. Russian officials said the death toll stood at 25 as of Monday, including five children.
Cities across western Russia regularly have come under drone attacks since May, although Ukrainian officials never acknowledge responsibility for strikes on Russian territory or the Crimean Peninsula.
The Kremlin's confidence has grown amid political divisions in the U.S. and the European Union over support to Ukraine that's held up aid to the government in Kyiv.
Ukraine's counteroffensive launched in June yielded only small gains, and Russian troops are now trying to press forward in Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Kharkiv.
Putin accused Western nations of using Ukraine to try and "put Russia in its place."
While vowing retribution, he insisted Russia would only target military infrastructure in Ukraine.
"Of course, we can hit public squares in Kyiv and in any other Ukrainian city," he said. "I understand -- I'm boiling with rage -- but do we need to hit civilians? No. We are hitting military targets, and that's what we will keep doing."
Both Ukraine and Russia have relied extensively on explosive droves during the war. The wave of Russian attacks in Ukraine continued throughout the day Monday.
A 15-year-old boy was killed and seven people wounded after falling debris from one of 87 downed drones hit a residential building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, the head of the region's military administration, Oleh Kiper, said.
Debris also sparked a number of small fires, including at the city's port.
Drone strikes and artillery fire also killed three people in Ukraine's Kherson, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, including a 73-year-old woman.
In the western city of Lviv, Russian attacks severely damaged a museum dedicated to Roman Shukhevych, a controversial Ukrainian nationalist and military commander who fought for Ukrainian independence during World War II. University buildings in the town of Dubliany were also damaged, although no casualties were reported.
Writing on social media, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi described the strike as "a war for our history" that was "symbolic and cynical."
Meanwhile, four people were killed and 13 more wounded following Ukrainian shelling on Russian-​occupied areas of Donetsk, according to the region's Kremlin-​installed leader, Denis Pushilin. Russian state media reported that a journalist was among the victims, but provided no further details.
One person was also killed and another wounded in shelling on the Russian border town of Shebekino, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

Full text: Shelling in the Russian border city of Belgorod on Saturday killed 21 people, including three children, local officials reported.
A further 110 people were wounded in the strike, said regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, making it one of the deadliest attacks on Russian soil since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine 22 months ago.
Russian authorities accused Kyiv of carrying out the attack, which took place the day after an 18-hour aerial bombardment across Ukraine killed at least 41 civilians.
Images of Belgorod on social media showed burning cars and plumes of black smoke rising among damaged buildings as air raid sirens sounded. One strike hit close to a public ice rink in the heart of the city, which lies 25 miles north of the Ukrainian border and 415 miles south of Moscow.
While previous attacks have hit the city, they have rarely taken place in daylight and have claimed fewer lives.
Speaking on social media Saturday, Gladkov described the consequences of the strike as the worst the city had faced since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago.
Russia's Defense Ministry said it identified the ammunition used in the strike as Czech-made Vampire rockets and Olkha missiles fitted with cluster-munition warheads. It provided no additional information, and The Associated Press was unable to verify its claims.
"This crime will not go unpunished," the ministry said in a statement on social media.
The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation, and that the country's health minister, Mikhail Murashko, was ordered to join a delegation of medical personnel and rescue workers traveling to Belgorod from Moscow.
Russian diplomats also called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council in connection with the strike. Speaking to Russia's state news agency, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Britain and the United States were guilty of encouraging Kyiv to carry out what she described as a "terrorist attack."
Zakharova also placed blame on EU countries that had supplied Ukraine with weapons.
"Silence in response to the unbridled barbarity of Ukraine's Nazis and their puppeteers and accomplices from 'civilized democracies' will be akin to complicity in their bloody deeds," the ministry said in a statement.
Earlier Saturday, Moscow officials had reported shooting down 32 Ukrainian drones over the country's Moscow, Bryansk, Oryol and Kursk regions.
They also reported that cross-border shelling had killed two other people in Russia. A man died and four other people were wounded when a missile struck a private home in the Belgorod region late Friday, and a 9-year-old was killed in a separate incident in the Bryansk region.
Russian drone strikes against Ukraine continued Saturday, with the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reporting that 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones had been shot down across the Kherson, Khmelnytskyi and Mykolaiv regions.
Local officials reported that three people had been killed by Russian missiles: a 55-year-old man in the Kherson region; a 43-year-old man in Stepnohirsk, a town in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region; and a 32-​year-old in the Chernihiv region.
On Friday, Moscow's forces launched 122 missiles and dozens of drones across Ukraine, an onslaught described by one air force official as the biggest aerial barrage of the war.
As well as the 41 deaths, at least 160 people were wounded and an unknown number were buried under rubble in the assault, which damaged a maternity hospital, apartment blocks and schools.
Western officials and analysts recently warned that Russia limited its cruise missile strikes for months in an apparent effort to build up stockpiles for massive strikes during the winter, hoping to break the Ukrainians' spirit.
Russia's ongoing aerial attacks have also sparked concern for Ukraine's neighbors.
Poland's defense forces said Friday that an unknown object had entered the country's airspace before vanishing off radars, and that all indications pointed to it being a Russian missile.
Speaking to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Russia's charge d'affaires in Poland, Andrei Ordash, said Saturday that Moscow would not comment on the event until Warsaw had given the Kremlin evidence of an airspace violation.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- A Ukrainian missile strike hit a Russian warship moored in Crimea early Tuesday, in what appeared to be one of the most significant attacks against Moscow's prized Black Sea Fleet in months amid Kyiv's intensified campaign to target the Russian-occupied peninsula.
The Ukrainian air force said in a statement that it had destroyed the Novocherkassk, a large landing ship, overnight in the southeastern Crimean port of Feodosia.
Russia's Defense Ministry told the Tass state news agency that the ship had been damaged in an attack using "aircraft-guided missiles" but did not say whether the vessel had been permanently disabled.
Videos of the attack apparently taken by residents and released by the Ukrainian air force showed a huge explosion that produced a large fireball, followed by a giant cloud of smoke and fire billowing into the night sky.
The footage could not be immediately verified, but Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of Crimea, said the attack started a fire in Feodosia. One person was killed and two were wounded in the assault, he added.
"The fleet in Russia is getting smaller and smaller!" Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of Ukraine's air force, wrote in a post on the Telegram messaging app celebrating the strike, which he noted came after Ukrainian missiles sank the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet last year.
The Ukrainian military has long maintained that the war cannot be won without taking aim at Russian assets and operations in Crimea, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014. In recent months, Ukraine has accelerated the pace of strikes on the peninsula, which Russia's military uses as a logistics hub for its hold on southern Ukraine and as a launchpad for attacks.
The Black Sea Fleet has fired devastating precision cruise missiles at cities and towns deep inside Ukraine. In an attempt to reduce the threat, the Ukrainian military has repeatedly targeted the fleet this year -- damaging a warship in August and hitting the fleet's headquarters a month later.
Those attacks were significant achievements for a country without warships of its own and rare successes in a year marked by disappointing efforts to break through Russian defensive lines on the battlefield.
The Ukrainian air force said it had used cruise missiles in Tuesday's attack, which took place around 2:30 a.m. local time in southeastern Crimea. Russia's Defense Ministry told Tass that two Ukrainian Su-24 fighter jets involved in the attack on Feodosia had been "destroyed" -- a claim that Ukraine's military denied.
While the extent of the damage to the ship was not immediately clear, the attack hit what appeared to be a valuable target. Interfax, a Russian news agency, reported Russian President Vladimir Putin had been informed of the attack.
The 360-foot-long Novocherkassk was capable of transporting up to 10 tanks and several hundred troops, according to Russian news media. About a month after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine's air force said it had targeted the Novocherkassk in an attack on the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk. In June that year, Tass reported the ship was part of a group of 12 vessels "ready to perform combat tasks in the Black Sea."
Ukraine's military said Tuesday that it suspected that the ship was carrying Iranian-made attack drones for use in the war.
Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army in the south, told national television that "it is clear that such a large detonation was caused not just by fuel or ammunition of the ship itself."
Andrii Klymenko, head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, agreed.
"Judging by the video of the explosion, which was very powerful, it was carrying explosives: either shells or missiles, or, as some people say, drones," he wrote in a text message.
Klymenko noted that the port of Feodosia was close to Cape Chauda, which he said Russia has long used as a launch site for attack drones.
Data compiled by his institute shows that the Ukrainian military carried out at least 155 attacks on Crimea and the Russian Black Sea Fleet from January to October this year -- averaging one every other day. Amid the intensified campaign, Russia relocated vessels from Sevastopol harbor, the fleet's home port.
Some of those ships, Klymenko said, were moved to the port of Novorossiysk, a Black Sea naval and shipping hub, or to the eastern side of Crimea, which was seen as less vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian sea drones. But Tuesday's attack on Feodosia, which is on Crimea's eastern coast, underscored those ports were still at risk.
The strike came as Ukraine signaled that it was preparing for a protracted war against Russia. On Monday, the government introduced a bill in Parliament that proposes lowering the age of people who can be drafted into the military to 25 from 27.
The bill also proposes the introduction of a three-month military training course for all Ukrainians ages 18 to 25, plus changes to the conscription process.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces have scored small territorial gains along Ukraine's eastern front in recent weeks, using their manpower advantage in grueling battles and prompting Ukrainian authorities to consider a push to mobilize up to 500,000 soldiers to sustain the exhausting fight next year.
The chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said this week that he saw no alternative to a large-scale mobilization to make up for Ukraine's losses. And President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that his army chiefs have asked him to mobilize 450,000 to 500,000 men.
Although many Ukrainians have yet to be drafted into the military, authorities are reluctant to resort to mass conscription for fear of stirring up social tensions.
Most recently, Russian troops have been closing in on the city of Avdiivka, a Ukrainian stronghold in the Donetsk region. The capture of Avdiivka would be a strategic success for Russia -- the city is a linchpin of Ukrainian defenses in the region -- and would deal a blow to Ukrainian morale.
Russia's recent advances near Avdiivka, as well as around such cities as Kupiansk, Bakhmut and Marinka, are also further evidence that Russia has firmly seized the initiative on much of the battlefield, after Ukraine's top general acknowledged last month that his country's summer counteroffensive had stalled.
Russia is making that progress at a critical moment for the government in Ukraine. Political infighting in Washington and in the European Union has blocked the delivery of military and financial aid packages that Ukraine says it desperately needs to hold its lines against Russia.
"Currently, the situation on the front line is difficult and is gradually deteriorating," Yehor Chernev, the deputy chair of the Ukrainian Parliament's committee on national security, defense and intelligence, said in an interview. "Without American ammunition, we are beginning to lose territory that was hard won this summer."
On Friday, departing Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands announced that his government was preparing to send Ukraine a first batch of 18 F-16 fighter jets, the powerful aircraft that Ukraine has long been lobbying for and on which Ukrainian pilots have begun training.
Ukraine has argued that the jets could help it challenge Russia's air superiority in some parts of the battlefield.
Since launching offensive operations near Avdiivka in October, Russia has gained a total of about 7 miles in all directions around the city, according to the Institute for the Study of War.
"But it has cost them dearly," Oleksandr Shtupun, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army, told national television Wednesday. He noted that Russia had suffered 25,000 casualties in the east over two months, most of them around Avdiivka.
Although these figures could not be independently verified, Britain's military intelligence agency said last month that Russia was probably experiencing the highest casualty rates of the war so far and that the battle for Avdiivka was likely the reason.
Nonetheless, Russia's incremental gains largely result from the sheer mass of its army.
"I would say the motto of their attacks is 'We have more people than you have ammunition, bullets, rockets and shells,' " Tykhyi, a major fighting with the Ukrainian National Guard in Avdiivka, said in audio messages, using only his call sign to identify himself, as per Ukrainian military rules.
Russia's offensive push in the east has consisted of a series of localized assaults following an arc that stretches from Kupiansk in the north to Marinka more than 120 miles to the south.

Full text: Russian President Vladimir Putin's confidence seems to know no bounds.
Buoyed by Ukraine's failed counteroffensive and flagging Western support, Putin says that Russia's war goals have not changed. Addressing his generals Tuesday, he boasted that Ukraine was so beleaguered that Russia's invading troops were doing "what we want."
"We won't give up what's ours," he pledged, adding dismissively, "If they want to negotiate, let them negotiate."
But in a recent push of back-channel diplomacy, Putin has been sending a different message: He is ready to make a deal.
Putin has been signaling through intermediaries since at least September that he is open to a cease-fire that freezes the fighting along the current lines, far short of his ambitions to dominate Ukraine, two former senior Russian officials close to the Kremlin and U.S. and international officials who have received the message from Putin's envoys say.
Putin also sent out feelers for a cease-fire deal a year earlier, in the fall of 2022, according to U.S. officials.
That quiet overture, not previously reported, came after Ukraine routed Russia's army in the country's northeast. Putin indicated that he was satisfied with Russia's captured territory and ready for an armistice, they said.
Putin's repeated interest in a cease-fire is an example of how opportunism and improvisation have defined his approach to the war behind closed doors. Dozens of interviews with Russians who have long known him and with international officials with insight into the Kremlin's inner workings show a leader maneuvering to reduce risks and keep his options open in a war that has lasted longer than he expected.
"They say, 'We are ready to have negotiations on a cease-fire,' " said one senior international official who met with top Russian officials this fall. "They want to stay where they are on the battlefield."
There is no evidence that Ukraine's leaders, who have pledged to retake all their territory, will accept such a deal. Some U.S. officials say it could be a familiar Kremlin attempt at misdirection and does not reflect genuine willingness by Putin to compromise.
In the past 16 months, Putin swallowed multiple humiliations -- embarrassing retreats, a once-friendly warlord's mutiny -- before he arrived at his current state of relaxed confidence. All along, he waged a war that has killed or maimed hundreds of thousands while exhibiting contradictions that have become hallmarks of his rule.
While obsessed with Russia's battlefield performance and what he sees as his historic mission to retake "original Russian lands," he has been keen for most Russians to go on with normal life. While readying Russia for years of war, he is quietly trying to make it clear that he is ready to end it.
"He really is willing to stop at the current positions," one of the former senior Russian officials told The New York Times, relaying a message he said the Kremlin was quietly sending. The former official added, "He's not willing to retreat 1 meter."
Putin, the current and former officials said, sees a confluence of factors creating an opportune moment for a deal: a battlefield that seems stuck in a stalemate, the fallout over Ukraine's disappointing offensive, its flagging support in the West, and, since October, the distraction of the Israel-​Hamas war. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, like others interviewed for this story, because of the sensitive nature of the back-channel overtures.
Responding to written questions after declining an interview request, Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a voice message that "conceptually, these theses you presented, they are incorrect."
Asked whether Russia was ready for a cease-fire at the current battle lines, he pointed to the president's recent comments: Putin said this month that Russia's war goals had not changed.
Ukraine has been rallying support for its own peace formula, which requires Moscow to surrender all captured Ukrainian territory and pay damages. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that he saw no sign that Russia wanted to negotiate.
"We just see brazen willingness to kill," he said.
Since at least September, Western officials have been picking up renewed signals that Putin is interested in a cease-fire. The signals come through multiple channels, including via foreign governments with ties to both the United States and Russia. Unofficial Russian emissaries have spoken to interlocutors about the contours of a potential deal that Putin would accept, U.S. officials and others said.
"Putin and the Russian army, they don't want to stretch their capacity further," said the international official who met with top Russian officials this fall.
But many in the West are skeptical of a cease-fire.
President Edgars Rinkevics of Latvia argued that Putin was committed to war because he dreams of "reestablishing the empire."
"They never honored any agreements," Rinkevics said of the Russians, "and they have violated them immediately when they saw it was convenient."

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces have scored small territorial gains along Ukraine's eastern front in recent weeks, using their manpower advantage in grueling battles and prompting Ukrainian authorities to consider a push to mobilize up to 500,000 soldiers to sustain the exhausting fight next year.
The chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said this week that he saw no alternative to a large-scale mobilization to make up for Ukraine's losses. And President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that his army chiefs have asked him to mobilize 450,000 to 500,000 men.
Although many Ukrainians have yet to be drafted into the military, authorities are reluctant to resort to mass conscription for fear of stirring up social tensions.
Most recently, Russian troops have been closing in on the city of Avdiivka, a Ukrainian stronghold in the Donetsk region. The capture of Avdiivka would be a strategic success for Russia -- the city is a linchpin of Ukrainian defenses in the region -- and would deal a blow to Ukrainian morale.
Russia's recent advances near Avdiivka, as well as around such cities as Kupiansk, Bakhmut and Marinka, are also further evidence that Russia has firmly seized the initiative on much of the battlefield, after Ukraine's top general acknowledged last month that his country's summer counteroffensive had stalled.
Russia is making that progress at a critical moment for the government in Ukraine. Political infighting in Washington and in the European Union has blocked the delivery of military and financial aid packages that Ukraine says it desperately needs to hold its lines against Russia.
"Currently, the situation on the front line is difficult and is gradually deteriorating," Yehor Chernev, the deputy chair of the Ukrainian Parliament's committee on national security, defense and intelligence, said in an interview. "Without American ammunition, we are beginning to lose territory that was hard won this summer."
On Friday, departing Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands announced that his government was preparing to send Ukraine a first batch of 18 F-16 fighter jets, the powerful aircraft that Ukraine has long been lobbying for and on which Ukrainian pilots have begun training.
Ukraine has argued that the jets could help it challenge Russia's air superiority in some parts of the battlefield.
Since launching offensive operations near Avdiivka in October, Russia has gained a total of about 7 miles in all directions around the city, according to the Institute for the Study of War.
"But it has cost them dearly," Oleksandr Shtupun, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army, told national television Wednesday. He noted that Russia had suffered 25,000 casualties in the east over two months, most of them around Avdiivka.
Although these figures could not be independently verified, Britain's military intelligence agency said last month that Russia was probably experiencing the highest casualty rates of the war so far and that the battle for Avdiivka was likely the reason.
Nonetheless, Russia's incremental gains largely result from the sheer mass of its army.
"I would say the motto of their attacks is 'We have more people than you have ammunition, bullets, rockets and shells,' " Tykhyi, a major fighting with the Ukrainian National Guard in Avdiivka, said in audio messages, using only his call sign to identify himself, as per Ukrainian military rules.
Russia's offensive push in the east has consisted of a series of localized assaults following an arc that stretches from Kupiansk in the north to Marinka more than 120 miles to the south.

Full text: The Biden administration is quietly signaling new support for seizing more than $300 billion in Russian central bank assets stashed in Western nations and has begun urgent discussions with allies about using the funds to aid Ukraine's war effort at a moment when financial support is waning, according to senior American and European officials.
Until recently, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had argued that without action by Congress, seizing the funds was "not something that is legally permissible in the United States." There has also been concern among some top U.S. officials that nations around the world would hesitate to keep their funds at the New York Federal Reserve, or in dollars, if the United States established a precedent for seizing the money.
But the administration, in coordination with the Group of 7 industrial nations, has begun taking another look at whether it can use its existing authorities or if it should seek congressional action to use the funds. Support for such legislation has been building in Congress, giving the Biden administration optimism that it could be granted the authority.
The talks among finance ministers, central bankers, diplomats and lawyers have intensified in recent weeks, officials said, with the Biden administration pressing Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan to come up with a strategy by Feb. 24, the second anniversary of the invasion.
The more than $300 billion of Russian assets under discussion have been out of Moscow's control for more than a year. After the invasion of Ukraine, the United States, along with Europe and Japan, used sanctions to freeze the assets, denying Russia access to its international reserves. But seizing the assets would take matters a big step further and require careful legal consideration.
President Joe Biden has not yet signed off on the strategy, and many of the details remain under heated discussion. Policymakers must determine if the money will be channeled directly to Ukraine or used to its benefit in other ways.
They are also discussing what kinds of guardrails might be associated with the funds, such as whether the money could be used only for reconstruction and budgetary purposes to support Ukraine's economy, or whether -- like the funds Congress is debating -- it could be spent directly on the military effort.
The discussions have taken on greater urgency since Congress failed to reach a deal to provide military aid before the end of the year. On Tuesday, lawmakers abandoned a last-ditch effort amid a stalemate over GOP demands that any aid be tied to a crackdown on migration across the U.S. border with Mexico.
A senior administration official said this week that even if Congress ultimately reached a deal for Ukraine, eroding support for the war effort among Republicans and Ukraine's increasingly precarious military position made it clear that an alternative source of funding was desperately needed.
U.S. officials have said current funding for the Ukrainians is nearly exhausted, and they are scrambling to find ways to provide artillery rounds and air defenses for the country. With Europe's own promise of fresh funds also stuck, a variety of new ideas are being debated about how to use the Russian assets, either dipping into them directly, using them to guarantee loans or using the interest income they earn to help Ukraine.
Seizing such a large sum from another sovereign nation would be without precedent, and would almost certainly lead to lawsuits and retaliation from Russia.
In a sign that some European countries are ready to move forward with confiscating Russian assets, German prosecutors this week seized about $790 million from the Frankfurt bank account of a Russian financial firm that was under EU sanctions.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of attempted drone attacks in the past day, just hours after Hungary vetoed $54.5 billion of European Union funding to Ukraine.
Ukraine's air force said Saturday that Ukrainian air defense had shot down 30 out of 31 drones launched overnight against 11 regions of the country.
Russia also said Friday evening that it had thwarted a series of Ukrainian drone attacks.
Russian anti-aircraft units destroyed 32 Ukrainian drones over the Crimean Peninsula, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Telegram. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world considered illegal, and has used it as a staging and supply point during the war.
Earlier, Russia's Defense Ministry said six drones had been shot down in the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine.
In Ukraine's partially occupied southern Kherson region, the Russia-​installed governor, Vladimir Saldo, reported on Telegram that Russian anti-aircraft units had downed at least 15 aerial targets near the town of Henichesk.
Stepped-up drone attacks over the past month come as both sides are keen to show they aren't deadlocked as the war approaches the two-year mark. Neither side has gained much ground despite a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June, and analysts predict the war will be a long one.
On Friday, EU leaders sought to paper over their inability to boost Ukraine's coffers with a promised $54.5 billion over the next four years, saying the funds will likely arrive next month after some more haggling between the bloc's other 26 leaders and the longtime holdout, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
German literary prize: The Russian American writer Masha Gessen received a German literary prize Saturday in a ceremony that was delayed and scaled down in reaction to an article comparing Gaza to Nazi German ghettos.
The comparison in a recent New Yorker article was viewed as controversial in Germany, where government authorities strongly support Israel as a form of remorse and responsibility after Adolf Hitler's Germany murdered up to 6 million Jews in the Holocaust.
Gessen, who was born Jewish in the Soviet Union, is critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.
Gessen was originally due to receive the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought on Friday in the city hall of Bremen, in northwest Germany, but the sponsoring organization, the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and the Senate of the city of Bremen withdrew from the ceremony.
It took place instead in a different location Saturday with about 50 guests and police security, the German news agency dpa reported.
In Gessen's article, titled "In the Shadow of the Holocaust," the author explores German Holocaust memory, arguing that Germany today stifles free and open debate on Israel.
Gessen also is critical of Israel's relationship with Palestinians, writing that Gaza is "like a Jewish ghetto in an Eastern European country occupied by Nazi Germany."
Kuwait's ruler dies: Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmad Al Sabah, Kuwait's ruling emir, died Saturday after a three-year, low-key reign focused on trying to resolve the tiny, oil-rich nation's internal political disputes. He was 86.
Authorities gave no cause of death.
The state-run KUNA news agency said Kuwait's deputy ruler and Sheikh Nawaf's half-brother, Sheikh Meshal Al Ahmad Al Jaber, now 83, had been named emir Saturday afternoon.
Sheikh Nawaf previously served as Kuwait's interior and defense minister. His political fortunes were never certain despite being part of the ruling Al Sabah family. As defense minister, Sheikh Nawaf oversaw the rapid collapse of his forces during Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's invasion of his country in August 1990. He faced widespread criticism for his decisions during the war.
Quaker Oats recalls granola: Quaker Oats on Friday recalled several of its granola products, including granola bars and cereals, saying the foods could be contaminated with salmonella.
Quaker, which is owned by PepsiCo, said in a news release that it has not received any reports of salmonella infections related to the recalled granola products. The full list of recalled foods includes granola oats cereals and Quaker Chewy Bars, which are also sold in PepsiCo's snack mixes.
The company is asking customers with recalled products to throw them away and contact its customer support line or visit the recall website for more information and reimbursement.
Alex Jones lawsuits: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' latest bankruptcy plan would pay Sandy Hook families a minimum total of $55 million over 10 years, a fraction of the $1.5 billion awarded to the relatives in lawsuits against Jones for calling the 2012 Newtown school shooting a hoax.
The families, meanwhile, have filed their own proposal seeking to liquidate nearly all of Jones' assets, including his media company Free Speech Systems, and give the proceeds to them and other creditors.
The dueling plans, filed late Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, will be debated and challenged over the next two months, with hearings scheduled for February that will result in a final order saying how much Jones will have to pay out.
Jones and Free Speech Systems, based in Austin, Texas, both filed for bankruptcy last year as the families were awarded more than $1.4 billion in a Connecticut lawsuit and another $50 million in a Texas lawsuit. A third trial is pending in Texas in a similar lawsuit over Jones' hoax conspiracy filed by the parents of another child killed in the school shooting.
Matthew Perry autopsy: Matthew Perry died from the acute effects of the anesthetic ketamine, according to the results of an autopsy on the 54-year-old "Friends" actor released Friday.
The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in the autopsy report that Perry also drowned in "the heated end of his pool," but that it was a secondary factor in his Oct. 28 death, deemed an accident.
People close to Perry told investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment used to treat depression and anxiety. But the medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perry's body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn't explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.
The report says coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, also contributed.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Top Biden administration officials were laboring Wednesday to try to reach a last-minute deal for wartime aid for Ukraine by agreeing to Senate Republicans' demands to bolster U.S.-Mexico border policies, with urgency setting in as Congress prepared to depart Washington with the impasse unresolved.
The White House was racing to lock in a deal in principle with key Senate negotiators, which would allow them to work on the text of legislation through the holiday break, according to two people familiar with the plans who requested anonymity to discuss them.
As details of the plan emerged, advocates for immigrants and members of President Joe Biden's own Democratic Party fretted about the policies under discussion. Some demonstrated at the Capitol, warning of a return to the hard-line border and immigration policies of the Trump era.
Congress has little time to reach an agreement on Biden's $110 billion request for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs that Republicans are holding up to demand changes to border policy. While White House officials and key Senate negotiators appeared to be narrowing on a list of priorities to tighten the U.S.-Mexico border and remove some recent migrant arrivals already in the U.S., Senate Republicans said that not enough progress had been made to justify staying in Washington beyond Thursday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Washington this week to implore lawmakers for support, but lawmakers were still ready to leave for weeks with one of the U.S.'s key international commitments -- helping halt Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion into Ukraine -- seriously in doubt.
Trump fraud trial: After more than 10 weeks, 40 witnesses and bursts of courtroom fireworks, testimony wrapped up Wednesday in former President Donald Trump's civil business fraud trial. But a verdict is at least a month away.
Closing arguments are set for Jan. 11, and Judge Arthur Engoron has said he hopes to decide the case by the end of that month. The case threatens to disrupt the 2024 Republican front-runner's real estate empire and even stop him from doing business in his native state.
The verdict is up to the judge because New York Attorney General Letitia James brought the lawsuit under a state law that doesn't allow for a jury.
James' lawsuit accuses Trump, his company and key executives -- including sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump -- of deceiving banks and insurers by giving them financial statements that padded the ex-president's wealth by billions of dollars.
The defendants deny any wrongdoing.
Cohen lawyer: A lawyer for Michael Cohen, the fixer-turned-foe of former President Donald Trump, appears to have cited court rulings that do not exist in a Nov. 29 legal filing seeking to have Cohen's post-prison supervision end early, according to a federal judge in New York who is threatening penalties.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman issued an order Tuesday telling attorney David M. Schwartz to provide by Dec. 19 copies of three rulings Schwartz cited in the motion he filed last month. If the copies cannot be produced, the judge said Schwartz should explain in writing why he should not be sanctioned.
Cohen, who declined to comment, was sentenced to prison in late 2018 after pleading guilty to tax evasion, campaign finance charges and lying to Congress. He served about 13 1/2 months in prison and a year and half in home confinement before being placed on three years of supervised release.
Cohen has served about two years of his supervised release from prison.
Hungary aid: The European Union on Wednesday relented and granted Hungary access to billions of euros in frozen funds just as Prime Minister Viktor Orban appeared ready to defy his EU partners and veto the opening of membership talks and vital financial aid for Ukraine.
A year ago, the European Union's executive branch blocked substantial amounts of money out of concern that democratic backsliding by Orban's nationalist government could put the bloc's budget at risk.
The billions withheld mostly concern "cohesion funds" earmarked for Hungary. This envelope of money, one of the biggest slices of the 27-nation bloc's budget, helps countries maintain their infrastructure at EU standards. They must apply for the money to fund building and other projects.
Now, the European Commission has ruled that Orban's government has addressed some of its concerns, notably on justice reforms. So it's willing to grant access to 10.2 billion euros, or $11 billion, to reimburse spending on approved projects.
But Brussels also had a warning.
"The commission will closely and continuously monitor, notably through audits, active engagement with stakeholders and in monitoring committees, the application of the measures put in place by Hungary," it said in a statement.
Critics say the commission's decision appears to be an attempt to influence Orban after he demanded that decisions on Ukraine's EU membership hopes and on a package of around 50 billion euros, or $54.1 billion, in aid for its war-ravaged economy be struck from the agenda at an EU summit starting Thursday.
Thai drug seizure: Thai police have seized what is being called a record haul of methamphetamine tablets in the western province of Kanchanaburi, close to the Myanmar border.
Officers found an estimated 50 million tablets hidden in sacks in a six-wheeler truck they stopped at a joint police-military checkpoint on Tuesday. The occupants of the truck -- a man and a woman -- were arrested.
The quantity of methamphetamine tablets seized is a record for Thailand, Jeremy Douglas, the Southeast Asia regional representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said Wednesday.
Pope's burial plan: Pope Francis says he wants to be buried in the Rome basilica of St. Mary Major, not in the grottoes of the Vatican like other popes, so he can be near his favorite icon of the Madonna.
Francis, who turns 87 Sunday, also said he never thought about resigning this year despite a series of health scares.
He said he has a trip confirmed to Belgium next year and visits under consideration to Polynesia and his native Argentina.
"It is true that all journeys are now rethought," Francis told N+ of Mexican broadcaster Televisa. "If they're close by, they can be done. If they're farther away they are rethought. There are limits."
It was Francis' first interview since his latest bout of acute bronchitis, which forced the cancellation of a trip this month to Dubai to participate in the U.N. climate conference.

Full text: The White House must get serious about reaching a deal with Republicans over aid to Ukraine and border security. It's time for President Joe Biden to end the bluster and work toward compromise. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans blocked the administration's $111 billion package on a procedural vote that required support from 60 senators for the legislation to advance. ...
Clearly the GOP is willing to give in on Ukraine as long as the president and Democrats do the same on border security. Given the scope of the immigration disaster the Biden administration has created, this is hardly unreasonable. The GOP priorities include measures to tighten the much-abused asylum screening process and more efficient detention policies that would discourage catch-and-release tactics. ...
Despite the rhetoric, the conditions for a deal are in place. Both sides agree on aid to Israel. Both sides control one legislative chamber. Republicans in the House are more likely to stomach the legislation if it contains the stronger border security measures that their Senate counterparts are demanding. Even the president has conceded the problems at the border, saying, "We need to fix the broken border system. It is broken." Senate Republicans have signaled a willingness to negotiate.
If "Republicans are going to move, and we're going to move, then let's sit down and talk," Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told The Wall Street Journal. While the GOP typically gets blamed for deadlocks, the real issue is whether the White House will stand up to vocal progressive agitators who favor open borders, a policy wholly rejected by the vast majority of the electorate.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads to Washington on an urgent mission to rally flagging Western support for his nation, the Russian military targeted Ukraine's capital with the most intense salvo of ballistic missiles in months.
Explosions boomed shortly after 4 a.m. Monday over snow-covered Kyiv: Missiles racing toward the city at several times the speed of sound had been shot out of the sky even before air alarms could sound and send civilians racing for shelter.
The bombardment came hours after a video circulated Sunday of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, sipping Champagne in Moscow and celebrating waning Western support for Kyiv as he declared that Ukraine has "no future."
All eight missiles aimed at Kyiv, a city of 3.3 million people, were shot down, and 18 Russian attack drones aimed at targets in southern Ukraine were defeated, the Ukrainian military said. City officials said that at least four people were injured by falling debris in Kyiv.
The attack came just more than two weeks after Russian forces targeted Kyiv with 75 drones -- the largest number aimed at the capital since Russia launched its full scale invasion nearly two years ago -- and less than four days after the Russian air force conducted the first major wave of strikes on Kyiv using its heavy bomber fleet in nearly three months.
"This was probably the start of a more concerted campaign by Russia aimed at degrading Ukraine's energy infrastructure," Britain's defense intelligence agency said on social media just hours before Monday's predawn assault, referring to the recent attacks.
The ability of Ukrainian air defense crews, using a variety of systems provided by Western partners, to shoot down nearly all incoming missiles and drones over the past week, is a vivid reminder of the vital role Kyiv's allies play in protecting millions from Russian assaults.
But with a White House request for additional military support for Ukraine stalled in Congress, further U.S. assistance is in doubt.
The European Union will seek to approve about $50 billion in aid for Ukraine in coming days, but Hungary has threatened to veto that effort, adding to a feeling of uncertainty that is pervasive across Ukraine.
Putin, who in the video that circulated Sunday declared that he intends to maintain his grip on power for the foreseeable future, also said he believes Ukraine will only grow weaker as Russia grows stronger.
"When you don't have your own foundations, you don't have your own ideology, you don't have your own industry, you don't have your own money," he said at an awards ceremony Friday at the Kremlin, holding a glass of Champagne in his hand. "You don't have anything that's your own. Then you don't have a future, but we have a future."
Putin launched his war in February 2022 on the false premise that Ukrainian statehood was a fiction, and he has twisted history in an attempt to justify the destruction of a neighboring state that threatens his imperial ambitions.
The spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, told the Agence France-Presse news agency in a report published over the weekend that the Kremlin has not changed its maximalist goals: the complete political capitulation of Kyiv and the surrender of vast swaths of Ukrainian land to Russia.
Fierce fighting continues to rage across the front line as Ukraine increasingly moves into a defensive posture and as Moscow masses troops for another winter offensive.
"The operational situation in the east remains difficult," Oleksandr Syrsky, the commander of Ukraine's eastern forces, said Sunday. "The enemy does not stop conducting offensive operations along the entire front."
Ukraine's military said there were nearly 100 clashes with Russian forces over the past 24 hours. Some of the most intense battles were taking place around the embattled city of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
While the situation on the battlefield remains deadlocked -- with Russia finding it as difficult to advance through heavily fortified lines this winter as Ukrainian forces did last summer -- Ukraine's diplomatic efforts appear to be intensifying.
Zelenskyy's office said he would travel from Argentina, where he attended the weekend inauguration of the country's newly elected president, Javier Milei, to Washington for meetings Tuesday to discuss "joint projects for the production of weapons and air defense systems, as well as coordination of the two countries' efforts next year."
His office said he "will focus on ensuring the unity of the United States, Europe and the world around supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian terror and in strengthening the international order based on rules and respect for the sovereignty of each nation."
Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said President Joe Biden would meet with Zelenskyy as a demonstration of America's "unshakable commitment" to Ukraine.
Zelenskyy will also meet with Rep. Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, the congressman's spokesperson said.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Saturday condemned Russia's intention to organize presidential election voting in occupied Ukrainian territory next year.
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said any such balloting held in the occupied regions in the country would be "null and void" and pledged that any international observers sent to monitor the Russian election would "face criminal responsibility."
Lawmakers in Russia on Thursday set the country's 2024 presidential election for March 17. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his candidacy for reelection. He is all but certain to win another six-year term.
Russian authorities are pondering whether to arrange voting in Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Moscow illegally annexed the regions in September 2022 but only controls parts of them.
Putin subsequently introduced martial law in those areas, and Russian lawmakers amended regulations to allow elections in territories where martial law was in place. Russian authorities held elections in the annexed regions in September for Moscow-installed legislatures; Ukraine and its Western allies denounced the votes as a sham.
The head of Russia's Central Election Commission, Ella Pamfilova, said Thursday that together with the Russian military, security forces and the Moscow-​appointed governors in Ukraine, election authorities would decide by Tuesday on "the possibility of holding" the presidential vote in the Ukrainian regions.
Texas abortion ruling: The Texas Supreme Court on Friday night put on hold a judge's ruling that approved an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis, throwing into limbo an unprecedented challenge to one of the strictest bans in the United States.
The order by the all-​Republican court came more than 30 hours after Kate Cox, 31, a mother of two from the Dallas area, received a temporary restraining order from a lower court judge that prevents Texas from enforcing the state's ban in her case. The court said in an order that it was temporarily staying Thursday's ruling "without regard to the merits." The case is pending.
Cox was 20 weeks pregnant last week when she filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind since the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that overturned Roe v. Wade. The order issued Thursday only applied to Cox and no other pregnant Texas women.
Cox learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her fetus was at a high risk for a condition that carried a high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to her lawsuit.
Officers acquitted: Two Indianapolis police officers were acquitted Saturday of using excessive force to strike two women with batons during arrests at a May 2020 protest against racial injustice.
Officers Jonathan Horlock and Nathaniel Schauwecker were charged with battery and official misconduct. They were among officers ordered to arrest people gathered in downtown in violation of an 8 p.m. curfew.
The jury found the officers not guilty of four of the charges they faced. The jury could not reach verdicts on one charge of battery and one charge of official misconduct, local news outlets reported.
Prosecutors argued the officers did not respond in a reasonable way to actions by the two women. The arrests reportedly left the women with multiple bruises.
The officers' attorney, John Kautzman, said the men did what they are trained to do. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has said the officers followed policy in their use of force.
The episode followed several days of protests downtown after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis.
Minn. man impaled: A Minneapolis store clerk died Friday after a customer beat him and impaled him with a golf club, police said.
The clerk, 66, was attacked at the Oak Grove Grocery, a neighborhood store near downtown Minneapolis. A 44-year-old suspect has been jailed on suspicion of murder.
Police responded to a call just before 1 p.m. and found the victim behind the counter "with a golf club impaled through his torso," according to a news release. The clerk died at a hospital.
Information from witnesses led police to a nearby apartment building. Police Chief Brian O'Hara said late Friday that the suspect barricaded himself inside for six hours. Officers eventually took the man into custody without incident.
14 slain in Mexico: A clash between gunmen from a criminal gang and residents of a small farming community in central Mexico left 14 people dead, local authorities said Saturday. Seven others were injured and still being treated for their wounds.
Video posted on social media Friday showed villagers with sickles and hunting rifles chasing down suspected gang members amid bursts of gunfire.
Mexico State Gov. Delfina Gómez and other local leaders condemned the clash Saturday, which occurred in Texcaltitlan, about 80 miles from Mexico City.
Italy blaze kills 3: A fire broke out in a hospital on Rome's outskirts, killing at least three people and forcing the overnight evacuation of the facility and its nearly 200 patients, officials said Saturday.
The blaze began in the emergency room of the St. John the Evangelist hospital in Tivoli around 11 p.m. Friday. The flames spread to a few other wards, "but the smoke went everywhere," said chief prosecutor Francesco Menditto.
Fire and police crews worked through the night to evacuate the 193 patients. Those in intensive care were transferred immediately to other hospitals.
The governor of the Lazio region, Francesco Rocca, acknowledged "notable delays" in updating Italy's aging hospitals with fire safety infrastructure.
EU sets AI rules: European Union negotiators clinched a deal Friday on the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence rules, paving the way for legal oversight of AI technology.
Negotiators from the European Parliament and the bloc's 27 member countries overcame big differences on controversial points including generative AI and police use of face recognition surveillance to sign a tentative agreement for the Artificial Intelligence Act.
The EU took the lead in the global race to draw up AI guardrails when it unveiled the first draft of its rulebook in 2021.

Full text: We are running out of time and money for Ukraine.
This week, the White House Office of Management and Budget made it clear that without the approval of additional funding, we will no longer be able to aid Ukraine.
If we fail to heed this warning, we risk derailing the progress Ukraine has made and handing Russian President Vladimir Putin a victory. We also risk sending a message to other autocrats that incursion into free democracies will go unopposed.
Putin's war in Ukraine threatens the liberal world order that so many fought and died for in World War II. The domino effect of his victory would jeopardize the free world for generations to come.
In the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations far away."
That is why we must act.
If we allow Putin to run roughshod over Ukraine, it is only a matter of time before we face the greatest conflict in Eastern Europe since World War II, requiring direct engagement by the United States to defend our NATO allies.
If Putin is successful in destroying Ukraine, he will seek to reconstitute the former Soviet Union. He would attempt to form a federation with Belarus and Ukraine by installing a puppet government and then target Moldova, the Baltics, Georgia and others. Those who suggest that Ukraine's war is not our fight fail to remember that should Russia expand its attack and cross a border into one of these NATO countries, we are bound by Article 5 of the NATO charter to defend them.
Simultaneously, we must show leaders in Beijing and Tehran that we will not cower in the face of tyranny -- that the values we fought for in World War II still matter. The Ukrainians' fight is our fight. They are fighting for the same principles on which NATO and the United Nations were founded.
The decisions we make here in Congress about this conflict will affect not only the survival of Ukraine and its neighbors -- they also will affect our own national security. To understand this, look to our history.
During World War II, Roosevelt championed the United States as an "arsenal of democracy" to describe our role in providing weapons to democracies fighting to defend themselves. This helped the Allied forces win the war, while kick-starting decades of manufacturing growth and the creation of 17 million new civilian jobs here at home.
The military aid we have appropriated for Ukraine is no different. It has delivered weapons to Ukraine and provided funding to replace that equipment for the Department of Defense, creating manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and improving our own military readiness.
Unfortunately, in recent months, Congress has repeatedly fumbled opportunities to send aid to Ukraine, bringing us to the do-or-die scenario we face today.
In September, a majority of Republicans voted against a $300 million aid package to Ukraine, and a few days later, leadership refused to include additional funding in the continuing resolution. With these actions, Republicans rejected the Reagan Doctrine, which states that we must stand by our democratic allies and defy Soviet aggression. Those values are now seemingly dead within the Republican Party.
To make matters worse, Republicans were mired in intraparty squabbles for three critical weeks, leaving Congress gridlocked.
There are those who have turned the issue of Ukraine funding into an unnecessary, unrealistic choice between Ukraine and Israel. But we do not have to choose.
In the words of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg: "We have the capability and the strength to address different challenges at the same time. We don't have the luxury of choosing only one threat and one challenge."
The conflict in Israel and the conflict in Ukraine are linked. After all, Hamas and Iranian representatives met with Putin in Moscow. Just as Iran is supporting Hamas' attack on Israel, Iran is also believed to be assisting Putin in his invasion of Ukraine.
To defeat the terrorist threat in Israel, we must also help Ukraine defend itself from an evil autocrat.
As the White House made clear this week: Time is running out to act.
We owe it to the American people and to our allies to protect democracy at all costs. We owe it to future generations to prevent an expanded global crisis. Now is our chance -- let's take it.

Full text: The White House warned Monday that the United States would run out of money to send weapons to Ukraine by the end of the year if Congress does not approve additional emergency support for the war that has been snarled by funding debates.
The warning, delivered in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was the latest Biden administration salvo against a growing number of Republicans who say they are weary of shouldering the costs and political capital of a war that could grind on for years.
Congress has so far authorized $111 billion for Ukraine and critical U.S. national security needs, according to Shalanda Young, the White House's budget director. In October, the administration asked for an additional $61.4 billion to continue helping the government in Ukraine stave off Russia.
But she said about 60% of the money approved -- $67 billion -- remained in the United States, largely to bolster U.S. weapons manufacturers that have ramped up production over the last year to meet Ukraine's insatiable demand.
Without more money to buy and supply additional weapons, Young said, the loss in U.S. assistance "will kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield, not only putting at risk the gains Ukraine has made, but increasing the likelihood of Russian military victories."
"We are out of money -- and nearly out of time," Young wrote in the letter, which was also sent to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the top House Democrat, and the Senate's two Democratic and Republican leaders.
She added: "The time to help a democratic Ukraine fight against Russian aggression is right now."
With the U.S. presidential election less than a year away, and as voters shift their attention to domestic issues, Republicans have increasingly used the war in Ukraine as a political cudgel against the Biden administration. House Republicans refused to include war funding in a stopgap spending bill last month to avoid a government shutdown, and while Congress generally supports stepping up the pace of military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas, GOP lawmakers are divided on whether to give more assistance to Ukraine as the war drags on.
Johnson is leading Republicans who now want the Biden administration to stem the number of migrants entering by tightening U.S. borders in exchange for more funding for Ukraine.
"The Biden administration has failed to substantively address any of my conference's legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in Ukraine, a path to resolving the conflict, or a plan for adequately ensuring accountability for aid provided by American taxpayers," Johnson said on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday, responding to the White House letter. "Meanwhile, the administration is continually ignoring the catastrophe at our own border."
Over the last several months, as aid has dwindled and Ukraine has struggled to push back Russian troops in a counteroffensive that has largely stalled, allies have worried about whether the United States will sustain its support of the nearly two-year war.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron is expected to raise the subject again this week on a visit to Washington, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent considerable time at a high-level NATO meeting last week trying to assuage doubts in Europe.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has long made clear how big a loss it would be to his war effort should American military assistance end. "We need three victories," he said Nov. 24. "The first is with Congress. It's a challenge. It's not easy. Not everything depends on us. But Ukraine must do everything it can, and even more, to ensure assistance. And I believe it will be."
In battlefield interviews, Ukrainian soldiers said the amount of U.S. weapons and other equipment had already begun to drop.
In a bunker of a front-line artillery unit more than 150 miles north of Avdiivka, in eastern Ukraine, soldiers recently looked at a screen of Russian armor arrayed across the enemy lines. They only had 20 shells per day allotted to them, which meant they could realistically hope to take out two targets.
When the same unit was in Kherson on the offensive last summer, they had five times as much ammunition at their disposal, the soldiers said.
European states, most notably Germany, have tried to fill the gap with more air defense systems, ammunition and other supplies, but will not be able to meet Ukraine's demands until the continent's defense industry ramps up -- a process that will take at least a year, and most likely longer.
The debate over more war funding is being driven by Republicans in Congress who want sweeping changes to the U.S. immigration system included in a $106 billion aid package that includes about $61 billion for Ukraine.
A bipartisan group of senators who are trying to broker a compromise have agreed to make it harder for migrants to be granted asylum in the United States, but that proposal has enraged some Democrats and failed to satisfy many Republicans.

Full text: The woman in the video, her face blurred, gave a blunt assessment of Russian military policy: Soldiers mobilized over a year ago to fight in Ukraine deserved to come home.
Why weren't they?
"Our mobilized became the best army in the world, but that doesn't mean that this army should stay there to the last man," she said. "If he did something heroic, spilled blood for his country sincerely, then maybe it was time to return to his family, make way for someone else, but that's not happening."
The speaker was part of a new, grassroots movement that has been gathering steam in Russia over the past several weeks. Women in various cities are seeking to stage public protests, challenging the official argument that mobilized troops are needed in combat indefinitely to secure their Russian homeland.
Hand-lettered posters behind the speaker in the video echoed that sentiment with slogans like "Do only the mobilized have a homeland?" A video of the speech, delivered at a rally in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk on Nov. 19, was released online.
The nascent movement is a rare example of public displeasure with the war, the kind that the Kremlin has sought to suppress through draconian laws. The women and the government officials have been involved in a delicate dance, with the protesters trying not to trigger those laws while the authorities seek to avoid hauling the relatives of active duty soldiers off to jail.
Authorities have so far stepped lightly, using intimidation and cajoling rather than detention or arrests. Permits to hold rallies in several cities were denied, and women in chat forums have complained about harassment.
Some said law enforcement officers visited them at home to inquire about their online activity and to warn them of the legal consequences of attending unauthorized rallies.
One main outlet for the protest movement has been a channel on the Telegram messaging app called "Put Domoy" in Russian, or "The Way Home," which has attracted more than 14,650 participants since it was founded in September.
The channel's organizers published a manifesto pressing for mobilized soldiers to be sent home after a year in the combat zone. "Military servicemen and their families -- unite and fight for your rights," the manifesto said in part.
Authorities in Moscow and in Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, rejected recent requests for a rally permit, with officials citing as the reason a restriction on public assemblies that was created to combat COVID-19. In Moscow, about 20 demonstrators unfurled posters with slogans like "No to Indefinite Mobilization" at a Communist Party rally on Nov. 7. The police led them away but didn't detain them.
Maria Andreeva, who helped organize the Moscow protest, said that the government had largely responded by offering more money and benefits to families of soldiers. "They agree to pay us even more, but only if we keep quiet," she said in an interview. "Many women need their husbands and sons, not payments."
Participants in protests across the country are fed up, Andreeva said. While crowing that more than 410,000 men have signed contracts to join the military this year, the government has brushed aside demands from the families to demobilize those drafted in 2022.
The rally in Novosibirsk, held by a different organization, was the result of a compromise between organizers and local authorities. Instead of a street demonstration, local civilian and military officials gathered in a government auditorium. The press was largely banned, and participants had to prove that they had a relative serving in Ukraine.
Chelyabinsk, a major Russian city in the center of the country, held a similar meeting in its City Hall.
In Novosibirsk, the organizers said countless women across Russia were "boiling" because all their quiet appeals and petitions fell on deaf ears. "The situation drove us, our relatives, to despair, and those mobilized to a critical degree of fatigue, both physical and moral," the group said.
The groups protesting take pains to stress that they are not unpatriotic and that they strive to respect the law. They say they are simply asking that the Kremlin introduce troop rotations.
When the Russian government implemented what it called a "partial mobilization" in September 2022, calling up 300,000 men, it said those conscripted would have to stay in the military until President Vladimir Putin decided that they could be discharged.
Having already enacted one mobilization, ordering another one would be politically unpopular. In the meantime, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed and wounded, including many in ongoing assaults in Ukraine at places like Avdiivka.
The official response to the demand for rotation has been indirect at best. Protest organizers noted that Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, made a statement last December saying that replacing the mobilized troops was one reason to raise the number of soldiers overall.
But in September, Andrei Kartapolov, the chair of parliament's defense committee, said there would be no rotation for troops in Ukraine, noting that "They will return home after the special military operation is completed." A petition with tens of thousands of signatures sent to the Kremlin evoked a similar response, Russian press reports said.
"Our men are already physically and mentally tired of being there," Andreeva said. "That's enough! We must act!"
A generation ago, an antiwar movement that coalesced around mothers opposed to the war in Chechnya was a significant factor in prompting the Kremlin to end the war there. The authorities have tried to ensure that no similar movement emerges out of the current protests.
The subject of rotations is a delicate matter for the Kremlin, which is seeking to make sure that any protests remain a regional issue and do not become national news that Putin would be forced to address, said Tatiana Stanovaya, who recently wrote about the subject in her analytical newsletter, R.Politik.
"The Ministry of Defense is cautious, preferring to boost soldier numbers whenever possible and keep them at the front," Stanovaya wrote. She said any decision on a new mobilization would be "undesirable in the run-up to the presidential election next year."
At a recent seminar on the presidential election in March, held in a town called Senezh, near Moscow, regional officials received instructions to prevent the women's protest movement from metastasizing into something larger, according to Russian press reports.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- A powerful wintry storm battered southern Ukraine on Monday, washing away Russian coastal defenses from some beaches on the occupied Crimean Peninsula. The storm, which Ukrainian meteorologists said was among the most intense in decades, snarled supply routes for both countries' armies and deepened the misery of tens of thousands of soldiers huddled in shallow trenches across the sprawling front line.
As temperatures plunged below freezing across much of the country, hundreds of thousands of civilians were left without power in Russian-occupied territories and tens of thousands more lost power across southern Ukraine.
All the hardships that a winter storm typically delivers were compounded and complicated by the exigencies of war. A blizzard stranded civilians on roads while complicating the movement of humanitarian aid to communities across Ukraine ravaged by fighting.
Violent waves stirred by hurricane-force winds threatened to tear maritime mines from their moorings in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea -- as less violent storms have done in the past -- complicating the navigation of already dangerous shipping lanes.
Russian and Ukrainian officials reported widespread flooding in coastal communities, and soldiers from both armies posted photos of the havoc the storm created. The storm raged on both sides of the front, with the Odesa region in southern Ukraine along the Black Sea among the hardest-hit areas. Around 150,000 families in the region were without power on Monday, city officials said.
Residents living in Crimea posted dozens of videos and photos of destruction up and down the Crimean coast, including along beaches where Russia had carved out miles of trenches and built other fortifications designed to thwart potential Ukrainian amphibious assaults, according to satellite imagery.
Even as the defenses were being constructed in the sand, military analysts had warned these would be vulnerable to storm surges that could wash them away.
A correspondent from the news organization Radio Liberty posted video of some of the damage as well as flooded Russian positions.
It was not possible to verify the extent of the damage to both military and civilian infrastructure on Crimea, but local Russian proxy leaders declared a state of emergency.
Oleg Kryuchkov, an adviser to the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, said at least one person was killed after being washed away by the waves, and several hundred civilians had to be evacuated from coastal communities.
In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin was briefed about the storms, which also caused widespread flooding in southern Russia, but he had no immediate plans to visit the impacted areas, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, told reporters, according to Interfax, a Russian news agency.
More than 1.9 million people were affected by power outages, the Russian Energy Ministry said.
More than 400,000 people living in Crimea were left without power, local officials said, and train service along the Black Sea Coast and over the Kerch Strait bridge was disrupted. One sailor died in the strait during the storm, Russian state media reported, but it was not clear if he was a civilian or soldier.
The bridge over the strait is the only land link between Russia and the occupied peninsula, and it has come under repeated attack by Ukraine.
Roughly 30 inches of snow had fallen by 7:30 a.m. in parts of the region, Ukrainian emergency services said. They reported snowdrifts more than 6 feet deep on some roads.
Russian authorities on the peninsula said the peak of the storm had passed by Monday afternoon and floodwaters would begin to recede overnight.

Full text: Ukraine tried to attack Moscow with dozens of drones, Russian authorities said Sunday, a day after Ukrainian officials reported that Russia had launched its most intense drone attack on Kyiv since the beginning of its full-scale war in 2022.
Russian air defenses brought down at least 24 drones over the Moscow region -- which surrounds but doesn't include the capital -- and four other provinces to the south and west, the Russian Defense Ministry and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a series of Telegram updates. None referenced any casualties.
Andrei Vorobyev, governor of the Moscow region, wrote on Telegram that the drone strikes damaged three unspecified buildings there, adding that no one was hurt.
One drone crashed into a 12-story apartment building in the western Russian city of Tula, 113 miles south of Moscow, wounding one resident and causing limited damage, local Gov. Aleksei Dyumin wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.
Moscow's Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports briefly shut down because of the drone attack, according to Russian state-run news agency Tass.
Both appeared to have resumed normal operation by 6 a.m. local time Sunday, according to data from international flight tracking portals.
Russian Telegram channels speculated that Ukrainian forces had deployed a previously unseen type of drone in the purported strike, pointing out some similarities to the Iranian-made weapons Moscow employs in its attacks on Ukraine.
The Russian capital has come under attack from drones since May, with Russian officials blaming Ukraine.
Military analysts commented at the time that the early attacks deployed Ukrainian-made drones that couldn't carry as heavy a payload as the Iranian-made Shaheds drones used by Russia.
Ukrainian officials didn't acknowledge the strikes, which came a day after Russia targeted the Ukrainian capital with more than 60 Shahed drones.
At least five civilians were wounded in the hourslong assault, which saw several buildings damaged by falling debris from downed drones, including a kindergarten.
The wounded included an 11-year-old child, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.
The Ukrainian air force early Sunday said it had brought down eight of nine Shahed drones fired overnight by Russian forces.
Also Sunday, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that two Soviet-made S-200 rockets fired by Kyiv were shot down over the sea of Azov, which stretches between the Crimean Peninsula and Ukraine's Russian-occupied southeastern coast.
According to local news sources, air raid sirens sounded earlier in Russian-annexed Crimea, which on Friday came under what Russian officials called a major drone attack.
Road traffic was briefly halted Sunday morning across the 12-mile bridge that connects Crimea to the Russian mainland.
There were no reports of casualties and no comment from officials in Kyiv.
Elsewhere, parts of Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine were left without power following a nighttime Ukrainian strike on a thermal power plant in the Donetsk region, a Moscow-installed local official reported on Telegram on Sunday.
According to Denis Pushilin, who heads the province that Russia illegally annexed last year, the attack on the Starobesheve plant took out the electricity in parts of the occupied cities of Donetsk and Mariupol, along with other nearby areas.
On the outskirts of Donetsk, Russian troops have continued their attempts to advance near Avdiivka, the eastern town that has been a Ukrainian stronghold and fighting hot spot since the early days of the war, according to reports by the Ukrainian General Staff and analysis by the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.
The Ukrainian General Staff said Sunday morning that Kyiv's forces beat back Russian assaults to the northeast, west and southwest of Avdiivka over the previous 24 hours, as Moscow's troops strain to encircle the city.
Several Russian bloggers also made unconfirmed claims that Ukrainian forces had begun withdrawing from the industrial zone on Avdiivka's southern flank, although others said that Russian troops lacked complete control of the area. These claims could not be independently verified.
Russian shelling killed two civilians in the Donetsk region Saturday and overnight, acting Ukrainian Gov. Ihor Moroz reported on Telegram on Sunday morning.
Over that same period, Russian shells wounded one person in Ukraine's northern Sumy province, which borders Russia, according to a Telegram update by the Ukrainian regional military command.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine launched one of the biggest drone attacks on the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula since the full-scale war that started with Russia's invasion 21 months ago, Russian officials said Friday. They did not mention any casualties or damage.
At the same time, Ukrainian officials reported that the Kremlin's forces escalated their weekslong and costly attempt to storm Avdiivka, a strategically important city in eastern Ukraine.
The stepped-up efforts came as both sides are keen to show they are not deadlocked as the fighting approaches 2024. Neither side has gained much ground despite a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June, and analysts predict the war will be a long one.
With winter weather setting in, bringing snow and freezing temperatures to the battlefield, Ukraine and Russia are looking to take ground that could provide platforms for future advances.
The Moscow-appointed governor for the Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine's Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said Ukraine launched a major drone attack on Crimea early Friday. He claimed that dozens of drones were shot down over the province and the northern part of Crimea.
Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world considered illegal, and has used it as a staging and supply point during the war.
The Russian Defense Ministry said air defenses downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and three more over southern Russia's Volgograd region.
Ukrainian officials did not comment on the Russian reports.
It was not possible to independently verify either side's battlefield claims.
Russia has been trying to capture Avdiivka since Oct. 10, using heavy bombardments and reportedly taking heavy losses. The city lies in the northern suburbs of Donetsk, a city in a region of the same name that Russian forces partially occupy. Avdiivka's location grants Ukrainian forces artillery advantages over the city and could serve as a springboard for them to liberate Donetsk.
Netherlands election: A senator from the Netherlands' Party for Freedom was appointed Friday to investigate possible governing coalitions after the far-right party's election victory, while the party of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it would support a center-right administration in parliament but not join the next government.
The Party for Freedom, or PVV, led by veteran anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, won 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house, indicating a seismic shift to the right for the Netherlands. Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy won 24 seats, 10 fewer than in the previous election, according to a nearly complete count of Wednesday's votes.
After a meeting of party leaders at the parliament, PVV Sen. Gom van Strien was appointed to investigate possible coalitions. Newly elected lawmakers will debate his findings on. 6.
The election result and appointment of Van Strien pave the way for Wilders to take the lead in forming a new coalition and potentially to succeed Rutte as prime minister. However, he will likely have to convince potential coalition partners that he would tone down some of his anti-Islam policies.
His party's election platform states that the Netherlands "is not an Islamic country. No Islamic schools, Qurans and mosques."
Combs accused by 2 more: Two more women have come forward to accuse Sean "Diddy" Combs of sexual abuse, one week after the music mogul settled a separate lawsuit with the singer Cassie that contained allegations of rape and physical abuse.
Both new suits were filed Thursday on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.
The filings detail acts of sexual assault, beatings and forced drugging allegedly committed in the early 1990s by Combs, then a talent director, party promoter and rising figure in New York City's hip-hop community.
Ex-aide accuses Cuomo: Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is being sued by a former aide who says Cuomo sexually harassed her while he was still in office.
Cuomo's former executive assistant Brittany Commisso filed the case against the ex-governor Wednesday in state Supreme Court in Albany. The filing, a three-page summons, came just before the expiration for lawsuits under New York's Adult Survivors Act.
Commisso was one of at least 11 women who accused Cuomo of sexual misconduct, leading to his abrupt 2021 resignation in a #MeToo-era scandal that marked a severe fall from grace for the Democrat.
He has denied the allegations.
Commisso's allegations led to a criminal charge against Cuomo that was eventually dismissed last year at the request of a county prosecutor who described her as credible but said he couldn't prove the case.
Hall sues Oates: Daryl Hall has sued his longtime musical partner John Oates, arguing that his plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged.
The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale while legal proceedings and a previously initiated arbitration continue.
A Nashville, Tennessee, chancery court judge issued the temporary restraining order Nov. 16, writing that Oates and others involved in his trust can't move to close the sale of their share of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC until an arbitrator in a separately filed case weighs in on the deal, or until the judge's order expires -- typically within 15 days, unless a judge extends the deadline.
Although the publicly released version of the lawsuit didn't specify what's at stake in the sale, Primary Wave has already owned "significant interest" in Hall and Oates' song catalog for more than 15 years.
India tunnel collapse: Rescue teams trying to reach 41 construction workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel in northern India for nearly two weeks stopped drilling again Friday after their boring machine hit a new metal obstruction in rock debris, further delaying efforts.
The construction workers have been trapped since Nov. 12, when a landslide caused a portion of the 2.8-mile tunnel they were building to collapse about 650 feet from the entrance.
Authorities have supplied the workers with hot meals of rice and lentils through a 6-inch pipe after days of surviving on dry food sent through a narrower pipe. Oxygen is being supplied through a separate pipe.

Full text: SUMY, Ukraine -- The Russian soldiers turned up at her home close to midnight with an ominous message.
"They said, 'If in two weeks you don't have a Russian passport, we will talk to you in a different way,' " recalled Evelina, a social worker who until this month lived under Russian occupation in southeastern Ukraine.
She didn't wait to have that conversation. Instead, she bundled a few possessions into a suitcase and left with her 16-year-old daughter, heading for territory controlled by Ukraine.
In the Russian-​governed lands, she said, it has become so tense that "you are afraid to look out your own window."
The military deadlock that has settled in across southeastern Ukraine poses a looming security threat to the rest of the country and menaces Europe with a long period of instability. But for the estimated 4 million to 6 million Ukrainians living in Russian-held areas, as Evelina was, the stalemate means something more dispiriting: an occupation with no end in sight.
Emptied of about half of its population and under the thumb of a harsh military rule, the swath of Russian-​occupied territory, an area the size of the Netherlands, is stuck in a distressing state of limbo: run by Russia but recognized by most of the rest of the world as Ukrainian.
Demographics in these regions are changing as working-age people flee, leaving an older and poorer population.
Russian soldiers quarter in abandoned houses and crime has risen. Russian businesspeople are strong-arming local business owners into selling stores and farms, and Central Asian migrants have shown up to trade in markets and work as laborers.
Searches are commonplace. Serhiy, 41, who left the city of Enerhodar this month, said his apartment was searched by three soldiers. "One stays in the stairwell with a gun, and the other two come inside and go through all your stuff," he said.
Repression, including torture in makeshift detention sites in basements, targets those who reveal pro-Ukrainian views, altering the political makeup of the area in Russia's favor but also shifting the cultural landscape away from Ukrainian language and identity.
Russia now controls about 17% of Ukrainian land, a half-moon-shaped expanse of farmland, villages and cities in the southeast. The region is off-limits to rights groups and most independent reporters, but accounts by people who have left the occupied areas offer a window into this portion of Ukraine.
Evelina took an unusual but increasingly popular route back into Ukrainian-​controlled territory: traveling into Russia and heading north and west, then back into Ukraine through an unofficial border crossing near the northern city of Sumy.
That path is taken by about 100 Ukrainians daily. They hire drivers or take public transportation in Russia to get to the border. From there, they stagger into Ukraine, a thin stream of exhausted families walking 2 miles on a rutted rural road between the two armies, an unlikely corridor of peace between two nations fighting a violent war.
The armies use the crossing to trade bodies and prisoners, and they have negotiated an informal truce that has mostly held, border guards working in the area said. Civilians got word of the site and those with a Ukrainian passport have been piggybacking on the informal cease-fire to escape occupation.
As they arrive, they rest for a time at a school used for interrogations by Ukraine's intelligence agency, known as a filtration site. In interviews, they described Russian repression and brutality but also functioning local governments and welfare systems, as Russia solidifies control.
For Evelina, fear of arrest and the growing anxiety of her daughter motivated her to leave.
Over the summer, it had seemed her hometown might soon change hands. It lies just 25 miles from the point where a Ukrainian counteroffensive began in June and was intended to push Russia from southern Ukraine. But the attack stalled after about 10 miles.
By the time she left this month, Evelina said, about half the population was accepting of the occupation, having received Russian passports and pension or welfare payments. She declined to identify the town, and like others interviewed for this article, asked that her last name be withheld for security reasons.
They lived, she said, alongside hundreds of Russian soldiers quartered in abandoned houses and newly arrived ethnic Azerbaijanis who sold goods at the local market.
The soldiers' late-night visit to her home, and their threat -- a policing practice that other displaced people said is commonplace -- terrified her daughter. "She cried, didn't talk and covered her face with a blanket," Evelina said.
Typically, the local occupation authorities install a collaborator as a figurehead leader for a local or regional government while a Russian military commandant exerts de facto control over a community.
For economic aid and expertise in municipal and local government, Russia has set up a sister city arrangement where Russian cities pair with those under occupation in Ukraine. The St. Petersburg city government, for example, has contributed some financing to redevelopment in Mariupol, the Azov Sea port city largely flattened in a siege last year. (The city government has said it is helping the Mariupol theater that was bombed last year.)
Occupation administrators have been offered jobs in Russia if they perform well, setting up a career path that encourages capable Russians and collaborators to hold positions in occupied Ukraine. A deputy head of the occupied Donetsk region, for example, became governor of the Siberian region of Omsk in Russia.
Those career opportunities arise for collaborators even if they subject the local population to seemingly underqualified leadership.
A man who had run a business providing Santa Claus actors for holiday parties, for example, became the head of the Donetsk region in 2014, when the Russian army and proxy fighters seized parts of eastern Ukraine.
Last year his wife became deputy head of the Kherson region.
More typically, Ukrainians recounted everyday pressure to obtain Russian passports and told of people being detained if they were overheard speaking ill of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- A war-battered Ukraine on Tuesday commemorated the 10th anniversary of the so-called Maidan revolution, the popular uprising that toppled a pro-Russia president, showcased the nation's embrace of European values and foreshadowed the current conflict with Moscow.
Across Ukraine, people laid flowers at monuments honoring those killed during the protests, and officials hailed the uprising that started in 2013 as a milestone on the road to achieving greater democracy and standing up to Russia.
In a video address released Tuesday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: "Ten years ago, we began a new chapter in our struggle. Ten years ago, Ukrainians launched their first counteroffensive." During the Maidan revolution, he added, "the first victory in today's war took place."
The uprising, ignited by popular outrage at a decision by Ukraine's president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych, to shelve a trade agreement with Brussels, was a powerful demonstration of the country's commitment to Europe.
The current war has accelerated those aspirations, with Ukraine now officially a candidate to become a member of the European Union. Several top European officials visited Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday to reaffirm their support to the war-torn nation, including Charles Michel, president of the European Council, and Boris Pistorius, Germany's defense minister.
The Maidan uprising "is also part of Europe's history," Kateryna Zarembo, an associate fellow at the Kyiv-based New Europe Center, said in an interview, adding that the visits demonstrate Europe's strong commitment to Ukraine.
The commemorations Tuesday were shrouded in a particularly deep sense of sadness as Ukrainians reflected not only on the lives lost in the struggle for independence over the past decade but also on the prospect that many more will die as bloody fighting continues.
"These men are now watching us from the sky," Rostyslav Karandieiev, Ukraine's acting minister of culture, said during a memorial in Kyiv honoring the 100 or so participants of the Maidan uprising killed by police.
"They were the first, but unfortunately not the last," he added.
Around him, mourners stood in the bitter morning cold holding bouquets of white and yellow chrysanthemums, next to marble portraits of the victims. They recited prayers, sang the Ukrainian anthem and shouted "Glory to Ukraine! Glory for the heroes!" -- the slogan around which the nation has rallied since Russia invaded last year.
The Maidan protests erupted Nov. 21, 2013, hours after Yanukovych announced that he was rejecting the trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer economic ties with Russia. Many Ukrainians supported the deal with Brussels, seeing it as a way to lessen Moscow's influence and improve living standards.
The protests were peaceful at first but escalated into violence as police started firing live ammunition into crowds of demonstrators, who armed themselves with makeshift shields and clubs.
Increasingly unpopular, Yanukovych fled to Russia and was removed from office by Ukraine's parliament, a moment that the country celebrated as a historic democratic victory.
But Russia viewed the protests as a Western-backed coup intended to distance Moscow from a country that used to be in its sphere of influence. Shortly after, Russian troops seized Crimea and instigated a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.
At the memorial in Kyiv on Tuesday, Ohla Salo, a museum worker, said, "When Maidan won, Putin understood that it would not be possible to take control of Ukraine other than by military means."
In his video address, Zelenskyy drew a straight link between the Maidan uprising and the current war.
"We fought, and we are still fighting," he said.
The commemorations Tuesday were clearly intended to bolster Ukrainians' resilience and courage in the face of Russia's invasion.
But participants in Kyiv could not hide a sense of growing fatigue as the war nears its 21st month and progress on the battlefield has mostly stalled.
"We understand that, maybe, victory won't be quick," Salo said.
Ukraine's military said Tuesday that its forces were facing fierce assaults by Russian troops in the east around the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka.
Serhii Tsekhotskyi, a Ukrainian officer fighting near Avdiivka, told national television that Russian forces had in the past few days sent driverless "kamikaze" vehicles packed with explosives toward Ukrainian positions.
Moscow said Tuesday that its forces had fended off attempts by Ukrainian troops to expand their control over a sliver of land they had secured on the Russian-occupied bank of the Dnieper River, near the southern city of Kherson. Russia's account could not be independently verified.

Full text: The drones began crashing on Ukraine's front lines, with little explanation.
For months, the aerial vehicles supplied by Quantum Systems, a German technology firm, had worked smoothly for Ukraine's military, swooping through the air to spot enemy tanks and troops in the country's war against Russia. Then late last year, the machines started falling from the sky as they returned from missions.
"It was this mystery," said Sven Kruck, a Quantum executive who received a stern letter from Ukraine's Ministry of Defense demanding a fix.
Quantum's engineers found the issue: Russians were jamming the wireless signals that connected the drones to the satellites they relied on for navigation. To adjust, Quantum developed artificial intelligence-powered software to act as a kind of secondary pilot and added a manual option so the drones could be landed with an Xbox controller. The company also built a service center to monitor Russia's electronic attacks.
"All we could do is get information from the operators, try to find out what wasn't working, test and try again," Kruck said.
A battle is raging in Ukraine in the invisible realm of electromagnetic waves, with radio signals being used to overwhelm communication links to drones and troops, locate targets and trick guided weapons. Known as electronic warfare, the tactics have turned into a cat-and-mouse game between Russia and Ukraine, quietly driving momentum swings in the 21-month old conflict and forcing engineers to adapt.
"Electronic warfare has impacted the fighting in Ukraine as much as weather and terrain," said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington, adding that every operation in the conflict now has to take into account enemy moves in the electromagnetic spectrum.
Electronic warfare has been a feature of wars for more than 100 years. During World War II, the British mimicked German radio signals to deceive targeting systems that bombers used, which Winston Churchill popularized as the "battle of the beams." In the Cold War, the Soviet Union invested heavily in electronic weapons to gain an asymmetric advantage against the missiles and planes from the United States.
In recent decades, the use of electronic attack and defense has been more lopsided. In the Iraq War in the 2000s, the United States used gadgets called jammers to create so much radio noise that improvised explosive devices could not communicate with their remote detonators. More recently, Israel has jumbled GPS signals in its airspace with electronic warfare systems to confuse would-be attacks from drones or missiles.
The war in Ukraine is the first recent conflict between two large and relatively advanced armies to widely deploy electronic warfare abilities and evolve the techniques in real time. Once the purview of trained experts, the technologies have spread to front-line infantry troops. Ukrainian drone pilots said they constantly fine-tuned their methods to parry the invisible attacks.
The tactics have become so critical that electronic warfare received its own section in a recent essay by Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine's top military commander. "Widespread use of information technology in military affairs" would be key to breaking what has become a stalemate in the conflict with Russia, he wrote.
The techniques have turned the war into a proxy laboratory that the United States, Europe and China have followed closely for what may sway a future conflict, experts said.
U.S. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raised the topic of electronic warfare this year in prepared remarks for a congressional hearing. NATO countries have expanded programs to buy and develop electronic weapons, said Thomas Withington, an electronic warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a British security think tank.
"The war in Ukraine has been the performance enhancing drug for NATO's electromagnetic thinking," he said. "It has been the thing that concentrates minds."
As Russian tanks rolled toward Kyiv, Ukraine, in February 2022, the Russian military initially made good on its reputation as one of the world's best at electronic warfare. It used powerful jammers and decoy missiles to inundate Ukrainian air defenses, leaving Ukraine reliant on aircraft to fight off Russian planes.
The electronic weapons do not appear dangerous at first glance. They are typically satellite dishes or antennas that can be mounted on trucks or set up in fields or on buildings. But they then beam out electromagnetic waves to track, trick and block sensors and communication links that guide precision weapons and allow for radio communications. Just about every communications technology relies on electromagnetic signals, be it soldiers with radios, drones connecting to pilots or missiles linked to satellites.
One basic but effective tool is a jammer, which disrupts communications by sending out powerful signals at the same frequencies used by walkie-talkies or drones to cause so much disturbance that beaming a signal is impossible. Jamming is akin to blasting heavy metal in the middle of a college lecture.
Another key weapon sends a signal that pretends to be something it is not, like a satellite link. Called spoofing, the fake signal can convince a drone or missile it is miles off course by feeding it false coordinates. In other cases, spoofers ape the signals made by missiles or planes to trick air defense systems into detecting attacks that aren't happening.
Other tools listen for beams of radiation and seek to locate their origin. These devices are often used to find and attack drone pilots.
After early success using these tools, the Russian military stumbled, analysts said. But as the war has stretched on, Russia has innovated by making smaller, mobile electronic weapons, like anti-drone guns and tiny jammers that form a radio-wave bubble around trenches.
To combat Russia's century of Soviet know-how in electronic attack and defense, Ukraine has turned to a startup approach associated with Silicon Valley. The idea is to help the country's tech workers quickly turn out electronic warfare products, test them and then send them to the battlefield.
At Infozahyst, one of Ukraine's biggest electronic warfare contractors, engineers recently worked on a project to track and identify Russian air defense systems. Iaroslav Kalinin, the company's CEO, said Russia's anti-aircraft radars were not as easy to replace as tanks. But if enough were eliminated, it could provide a turning point in the war.
"Once we control the sky, then Russia fails hard," he said.

Full text: An orphaned Ukrainian teenager who was taken to Russia last year during the war in his country returned home after being reunited with relatives in Belarus on his 18th birthday Sunday.
Bohdan Yermokhin was pictured embracing family members in Minsk in photographs shared on social media by Russia's children's rights ombudswoman, Maria Lvova-Belova.
Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed that Yermokhin had arrived back in Ukraine and shared a photo of him with a Ukrainian flag.
Yermak thanked UNICEF and Qatari negotiators for facilitating Yermokhin's return.
Yermokhin's parents died two years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine. Early in the war, he was taken from the port city of Mariupol, where he lived with a cousin who was his legal guardian, placed with a foster family in the Moscow region and given Russian citizenship, according to Ukrainian lawyer Kateryna Bobrovska.
Bobrovska, who represents the teenager and his 26-year-old cousin, Valeria Yermokhina, previously told The Associated Press that Yermokhin repeatedly expressed the desire to go home and had talked daily about "getting to Ukraine, to his relatives."
Yermokhin was one of thousands of Ukrainian children taken to Russia from occupied regions of Ukraine.
The practice prompted the International Criminal Court in March to accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin and children's rights ombudswoman Lvova-Belova of committing war crimes.
The court in The Hague, Netherlands, issued warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova's arrests, saying they found "reasonable grounds to believe" the two were responsible for the illegal deportation and transfer of children from Ukraine.
The Kremlin has dismissed the warrants as null and void. Lvova-Belova has argued that the children were taken to Russia for their safety, not abducted -- a claim widely rejected by the international community.
Also Sunday, Russian drones targeted Kyiv as the British Defense Ministry said there were "few immediate prospects" for major change along the Ukrainian front line as the war enters its second winter.
Russia launched 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones overnight, targeting the Ukrainian capital and the Cherkasy and Poltava regions, according to a military statement.
Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems shot down 15 of the drones.
The overnight strike on Kyiv is the second attack on the Ukrainian capital in 48 hours, said the city's Military Administration spokesperson, Serhii Popko.
He said the drones attacked Kyiv from different directions in waves that were "constantly changing vectors."
Preliminary reports indicated no casualties or critical damage, he said.

Full text: Faced with growing U.S. reluctance to send more military aid to Ukraine, European leaders are moving to fill the gap, vowing new support for Ukraine as it battles Russia in a war in Europe's backyard.
Several countries -- including Germany, Britain and Norway -- are increasing production of weapons, especially the artillery ammunition that Ukraine so badly needs. Germany, once a laggard in providing aid to Ukraine, announced a week ago that it planned to double its support to $8.5 billion in 2024 and would deliver more crucial air defense systems by the end of this year. And European Union states are gearing up to train an additional 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers, bringing the total to 40,000.
But that may be little comfort to Ukraine, where a counteroffensive against invading Russian forces has stalled as winter approaches, and officials say more support is needed now, even as many countries turn their attention to the Israel-Hamas war.
European officials have long worried that rising Republican opposition to the military support that the United States is sending to Ukraine -- $45 billion in weapons and other equipment so far -- would diminish America's leading role in funding the war should President Joe Biden lose reelection. Those concerns were made all the more acute this month when House Republicans shelved Biden's $105 billion plan for emergency aid for several world crises, including about $61.4 billion for Ukraine.
"We Europeans, who have the necessary means to do so, have to be willing politically and materially to help Ukraine and to continue to do so, even to take over from the United States if, as is perhaps likely, its support diminishes," Josep Borrell, the EU's top diplomat, said recently.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 jolted European leaders, who realized their militaries and defense industries were ill-prepared for the war in their backyard. It was a "rude awakening," Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said this month, but one that united most of Europe behind Ukraine -- considered by many to be something of a buffer zone between Russia and NATO.
"If the West stops supporting Ukraine, there will be no more Ukraine and no more European security architecture," Yonatan Vseviyov, a top Estonian diplomat, said in an interview published Friday on the Ukrainian news agency RBC.
In Ukraine: Ukrainian troops worked to push back Russian forces positioned on the east bank of the Dnieper River, the military said Saturday, a day after Ukraine claimed to have secured multiple bridgeheads on that side of the river that divides the country's partially occupied Kherson region.
In Hungary: Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Saturday that Ukraine is "light years away" from joining the European Union, further signaling that his government is likely to present a roadblock to Kyiv's ambitions to join the bloc.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- For months, Ukrainian forces have been carrying out stealth raids into Russian-held territory on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River near the southern city of Kherson. The operations have been shrouded in secrecy, with small groups of Ukrainian soldiers crossing the river at night to avoid Russian drones, and officials remaining tight-lipped about the fierce fighting.
On Friday, Ukrainian officials broke their silence and said their forces had seized a sliver of land on the Russian-controlled bank, a claim that was supported by geolocated footage of troop positions along the front line.
"We managed to gain a foothold on several bridgeheads," the Ukrainian Marine Corps said on Facebook, using a military term for a secured position on the enemy side of a river. The Ukrainian military's general staff reported "a series of successful operations" on the left bank of the Dnieper, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a short message with photos showing Ukrainian soldiers operating small boats on a waterway.
"Left bank of Kherson region," Zelenskyy said. "Our warriors."
Military analysts said the announcements were likely intended to offer a glimmer of hope for Ukraine and its Western allies after weeks of sobering developments like a stalled counteroffensive and uncertainty over continued U.S. military aid.
But they added that such small territorial gains were unlikely to translate into rapid breakthroughs. Instead, experts expect Ukrainian forces to focus on securing their positions in the area, possibly aiming to use them as a springboard for a future counteroffensive.
"Their current capacities to move forward deeper toward Crimea are simply not there," Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst for Rochan Consulting in Poland, said in an interview, referring to the southern Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow illegally annexed in 2014.
A long-term goal, said Muzyka, who recently returned from a research trip on Ukraine's battlefield, "could be for these forces to maintain the bridgeheads over the winter, expanding them where possible," while Ukraine's military leaders consider options for a new southern offensive next year.
The cross-river attacks began this summer, when Ukrainian troops started harassing Russian forces in night raids, using small boats to drop off soldiers at various points along the meandering river. A marine sergeant, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media for security reasons, described a bloody fight with such intense shelling on the left bank that units battling there rotated every three days.
Military analysts initially viewed the raids as an attempt to tie down Russian troops in the area and prevent them from being moved to other parts of the front where Russia was on the offensive, such as in the east.
After weeks of fighting, geolocated footage showing an expanded Ukrainian foothold, along with reports by Russian military bloggers that Ukraine had moved some armored vehicles into the area, suggested a more ambitious operation.
Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of the occupied part of the Kherson region, acknowledged in a statement Wednesday that "small groups" of Ukrainian soldiers were operating in an area from a Dnieper railway bridge to the village of Krynky, a distance of about 12 miles. Ukrainian soldiers involved in the operations said it had taken long hours of wading through mud just to reach the village.
Muzyka, the military analyst, said that despite the grueling fighting, Ukraine had continued its Dnieper assaults to show its allies that it could still achieve some success and "give the West reasons to sustain military support for Ukraine."
Some Republican lawmakers in Washington are questioning the merits of doing so in the face of slow progress on the battlefield.
The Ukrainian military's general staff also said that the attacks had aimed to "push the enemy as far away" as possible from the river's Ukrainian-held right bank to protect civilians in Kherson, which Russian forces have been shelling relentlessly.
A Russian-appointed official in southern Ukraine, Vladimir Rogov, suggested on Russian television last week that Ukrainian forces had cut off a road connecting several towns in the area, making it "necessary to take a detour and make a fairly large circle to deliver ammunition and personnel."

Full text: If these were normal times, Ukraine would be preparing to hold presidential elections in March. But with war raging and parts of the country under Russian occupation, that looks increasingly infeasible. Delaying the vote makes sense -- so long as the government commits to strengthening democracy in the meantime.
The practical challenges of holding an election in wartime are immense. Even if a semblance of campaigning were possible, the mere act of voting could pose unacceptable risks. Russian forces have no qualms about attacking civilian infrastructure, and landmines make travel to polling booths hugely dangerous. The safety of election monitors can't be guaranteed. And securing election documents and transporting them to voting stations would strain scarce military resources.
It's also doubtful that the electorate would be truly representative. Of the estimated 32 million eligible voters who were in Ukraine before the war, as many as a quarter are now abroad and would depend on their host countries to organize ballots and supervise the counting or transfer of them to Ukraine. About 7 million voters -- more than 20% of the country's population -- are thought to be living in territories occupied by Russian forces, with another estimated 2 million or so in Russia itself. Elections in such circumstances don't necessarily strengthen democracy.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would almost certainly win a new mandate, but he would also have to overcome legal obstacles to call an election, as Ukraine's constitution forbids voting under martial law. Ukrainians themselves aren't exactly clamoring for a vote.
Yet Zelenskyy must ensure that such a measure is temporary. An indefinite delay would sap his legitimacy and open him to further criticism. It would embolden detractors in the West who want to cut off support for Kyiv. And it would undermine the contrast between democratic Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's Russia, a country where opposition figures often wind up dead, imprisoned or in exile. In the absence of elections, Ukrainian officials need to reinforce their commitment to democratic values. ...

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian police and prosecutors have accused two politicians and a former prosecutor of treason, saying they colluded with a Russian intelligence agency in aiding an effort by Rudy Giuliani several years ago to tie the Biden family to corruption in Ukraine.
Those accused include Kostyantyn Kulyk, a former Ukrainian deputy prosecutor general who had drafted a memo in 2019 suggesting Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son, for his role serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
Also implicated were a current member of Ukraine's parliament, Oleksandr Dubinsky, and a former member, Andrii Derkach, who had publicly advocated an investigation in Ukraine into Hunter Biden. They had also promoted a spurious theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The three were indicted on charges of treason and belonging to a criminal organization. The charges refer to "information-subversive activities" and focus on actions in 2019 before the U.S. presidential election. They do not say if or when the activity stopped.
In the run-up to the 2020 election in the United States, Giuliani and later President Donald Trump had encouraged Ukrainian officials to follow up on the allegations against Hunter Biden. The effort included a phone call by Trump to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July 2019 urging an investigation into the Bidens, at a time when the Trump administration was withholding military aid for the Ukrainian army.
Critics say that pressure to investigate the Bidens was politically motivated, aimed at harming the elder Biden's chances against Trump in the 2020 election.
Trump and Giuliani denied that there was anything inappropriate about their contact with Ukrainian officials, with Trump describing his phone call to Zelenskyy as "perfect." The administration said military aid to Ukraine was withheld over concerns about corruption in the Ukrainian government.
The events led to Trump's first impeachment in the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate.
Ukrainian media Tuesday suggested the indictments, too, had a political component for Zelenskyy: that they were intended to send a signal to Biden now, as his administration is pressing Congress for military assistance to Ukraine, that Kyiv will root out accused Russian agents, including those who had promoted accusations against his family.
In statements Monday, Ukrainian police and the country's domestic intelligence agency said all three men were members of a spy network established inside the Ukrainian government and handled by Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU.
The intelligence agency's statement said the Russians paid members of the group $10 million. Two members of the group, Derkach and Kulyk, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022, the statement said. Dubinsky was remanded to pretrial detention in a Ukrainian jail Tuesday.
Dubinsky, in a statement posted on the social networking site Telegram, said the prosecutors had "not presented one fact" to support the accusations, and that the charges were retribution for criticizing Zelenskyy's government in his role as a member of parliament. He said that he testified a year and a half ago as a witness in a treason investigation of Derkach but at the time had not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Dubinsky was expelled from Zelenskyy's political party in 2021 after the U.S. sanctioned him for meddling in the American political process.
The Ukrainian agency's statement said Kulyk had used his position in the prosecutor general's office to promote investigations that worked "in favor of the Kremlin," without specifying any cases.
In 2018, Kulyk compiled a seven-page dossier asserting that Ukrainian prosecutors had evidence that "may attest to the commission of corrupt actions aimed at personal unlawful enrichment by former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden," according to a copy leaked by a Ukrainian blogger.
The dossier suggested that Biden, when he had served as vice president, had tried to quash a corruption investigation into the natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where his son served on the board.
Former colleagues of Kulyk at the prosecutor's office confirmed he had written the document, which helped set in motion an effort by Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani, and other supporters to press for an investigation in Ukraine.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Thousands of trucks were lined up at several border crossings between Ukraine and Poland on Friday, preventing goods from being delivered to Europe and causing traffic jams lasting several days as Polish truckers blocked checkpoints over what they said was unfair competition from their Ukrainian counterparts.
Ukraine's infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said in a statement Thursday afternoon that more than 20,000 vehicles were blocked on both sides of the border.
The figure could not be independently confirmed -- a statement from Ukraine's state border service Thursday said the number of trucks prevented from crossing into Ukraine was 1,700 -- but there was little dispute that the disruption has been significant.
The waiting time for drivers at two of the three checkpoints protesters have been blocking was as long as seven days as of Friday afternoon, the fifth day of the protests, according to Polish authorities.
"Korczowa, Hrebenne, Dorohusk -- commercial traffic is at a standstill," read a message posted on the Facebook page of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Carriers and Transport Employers on Monday, the first day of the protest, in a reference to the three crossing points that have been blocked.
Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest wartime backers, but there have been broader tensions over Ukrainian exports transiting through Poland as Ukraine desperately tries to find alternative export routes to evade Russia's de facto blockade of the Black Sea, Ukraine's main trading route before the war.
This fall, Polish farmers protested over what they said was cheap Ukrainian produce seeping into the country's domestic markets and hurting their businesses, prompting Poland to ban agricultural imports from Ukraine.
Now, the Polish truckers claim the EU's decision to scrap permits for Ukrainian truckers after Russia's full-scale invasion last year -- a decision designed to help keep the Ukrainian economy afloat during the war -- has led to an influx of Ukrainian drivers, cutting into their profits.
The protesters' main demands are the restoration of transport permits for Ukrainian truckers, a move that would effectively limit the number of drivers from outside the bloc who could operate there, and a ban on transportation companies from outside the EU.
As of midday Friday, the waiting time was 50 hours at the Dorohusk checkpoint and 172 hours at Hrebenne, according to data from the Polish National Revenue Administration.
Ukrainian authorities said they were in contact with their Polish counterparts to resolve the issue. But Serhii Derkach, a deputy of Kubrakov, the infrastructure minister, seemed to suggest Ukraine would not compromise on the reintroduction of permits.
"For us, it is unacceptable in the conditions of war," he wrote on Facebook this week, citing the effect of the conflict on Ukraine's logistic chains and the suffering caused by Russia's obstruction of the Black Sea.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Thousands of trucks were lined up at several border crossings between Ukraine and Poland on Friday, preventing goods from being delivered to Europe and causing traffic jams lasting several days as Polish truckers blocked checkpoints over what they said was unfair competition from their Ukrainian counterparts.
Ukraine's infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said in a statement Thursday afternoon that more than 20,000 vehicles were blocked on both sides of the border.
The figure could not be independently confirmed -- a statement from Ukraine's state border service Thursday said the number of trucks prevented from crossing into Ukraine was 1,700 -- but there was little dispute that the disruption has been significant.
The waiting time for drivers at two of the three checkpoints protesters have been blocking was as long as seven days as of Friday afternoon, the fifth day of the protests, according to Polish authorities.
"Korczowa, Hrebenne, Dorohusk -- commercial traffic is at a standstill," read a message posted on the Facebook page of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Carriers and Transport Employers on Monday, the first day of the protest, in a reference to the three crossing points that have been blocked.
Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest wartime backers, but there have been broader tensions over Ukrainian exports transiting through Poland as Ukraine desperately tries to find alternative export routes to evade Russia's de facto blockade of the Black Sea, Ukraine's main trading route before the war.
This fall, Polish farmers protested over what they said was cheap Ukrainian produce seeping into the country's domestic markets and hurting their businesses, prompting Poland to ban agricultural imports from Ukraine.
Now, the Polish truckers claim the EU's decision to scrap permits for Ukrainian truckers after Russia's full-scale invasion last year -- a decision designed to help keep the Ukrainian economy afloat during the war -- has led to an influx of Ukrainian drivers, cutting into their profits.
The protesters' main demands are the restoration of transport permits for Ukrainian truckers, a move that would effectively limit the number of drivers from outside the bloc who could operate there, and a ban on transportation companies from outside the EU.
As of midday Friday, the waiting time was 50 hours at the Dorohusk checkpoint and 172 hours at Hrebenne, according to data from the Polish National Revenue Administration.
Ukrainian authorities said they were in contact with their Polish counterparts to resolve the issue. But Serhii Derkach, a deputy of Kubrakov, the infrastructure minister, seemed to suggest Ukraine would not compromise on the reintroduction of permits.
"For us, it is unacceptable in the conditions of war," he wrote on Facebook this week, citing the effect of the conflict on Ukraine's logistic chains and the suffering caused by Russia's obstruction of the Black Sea.

Full text: NEIVA, Colombia -- Manuel Barrios joined the battle against Russian forces in Ukraine because a bank threatened to repossess his home in Colombia. Luis Alejandro Herrera returned to the front to recover the savings he lost in a failed attempt to enter the United States through Mexico. Jhoan Cerón fought to provide for his toddler.
All three died in a war that their relatives said they knew or cared little about.
They were among hundreds of Colombian veterans who have volunteered to fight for Ukraine for the chance to make at least three times what they can earn at home.
"He said he was fighting a war in a country that wasn't his because of the dire need," said Barrios' wife, Maria Cubillos.
The stories of Colombian volunteers highlight the shifting nature of the Ukraine war, which has transformed from a fast-moving struggle for national survival into a war of attrition. Heavy losses and stalemated battles are forcing both sides to look for new pools of fighters to replenish their ranks.
For Ukraine, the mainly Western foreign volunteers who arrived last year because of moral conviction, a search for adventure or a hatred of Russia are being supplemented by fighters from poorer nations that more closely resemble the legal definition of mercenaries -- soldiers driven to foreign conflicts by financial gain.
"I would venture to say that not one Colombian has gone there to defend democracy," said Cristian Perez, who retired as a sniper in Colombia's army, worked under private security contracts abroad and is considering fighting in Ukraine. "I don't believe they have even heard of Ukraine before the war. Everything comes down to economic motivations."
Colombia offers fertile ground for recruiting because decades of struggle against Marxist insurgencies and drug cartels have left the country with the largest army in South America.
Still, foreign fighters make up a tiny fraction of Ukraine's military.
Ukraine's enemy, Russia, has had to put much greater emphasis on financial benefits including death insurance, and subsidized mortgages, to entice volunteers. And Russia has also exploited global economic upheaval to sign up fighters driven by financial need, including men with limited military experience from Central Asia, Nepal and Cuba.
And as the fighting settles into inconclusive, brutal trench warfare, material motivations are becoming even more prominent.
The Ukrainian military would not provide estimates for Colombian or other foreign fighters in its ranks, citing operational security. Colombia's government has also not provided any figures, emphasizing that the volunteers, while still citizens, no longer have ties to Colombian institutions.
Interviews with four Colombian volunteers who have served in Ukraine, as well as a review of audio and text messages sent by fighters there, indicate that hundreds of Colombian volunteers are in Ukraine at any given time.
"We welcome help from every citizen of the world who is ready to fight evil," said Oleksandr Shahuri, a spokesperson for one of the main military units employing Colombian volunteers, the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, also known as the Foreign Legion.
A nation of 50 million, Colombia has long exported experienced fighters. A security alliance with the United States has made its soldiers some of the best trained and equipped in Latin America, and prolonged combat has given them experience matched by few traditional militaries.
For poor Colombian men, the military has long offered one of the few legal pathways to some financial security. Retired professional soldiers in Colombia receive a lifelong monthly pension of $400 to $600, as well as free health care for their families.
Still, those benefits are often not enough to make ends meet and many realize that the skills they have honed in jungles and mountains have little use in civilian life.
The war in Ukraine gives Colombian veterans a rare opportunity to change their fortunes, while fighting for an internationally recognized government supported by the United States.
"He always had the ambition of being something more," said Paola Ortiz, the widow of Herrera, who returned to Ukraine for a second tour this year after being deported from the United States. "He wanted to send his children to college, to buy a house, to open a business."
More than a dozen Colombian veterans and their relatives described in interviews the volunteering process.
Colombian men travel on their own to Poland, often selling prized possessions, such as cars, to afford the trip.
At the Ukrainian border, they use translation apps to tell border guards that they have military experience and want to fight for Ukraine. Once inside the country, they present themselves at a military base in the western city of Ternopil.
After an interview and a perfunctory medical exam, they are put on a waiting list for one of two main destinations for Latin American fighters -- the Foreign Legion or the Carpathian Sich 49th Infantry Battalion.
They open a local bank account and send debit cards to their families, allowing them to withdraw earnings from a Colombian ATM.
Colombian soldiers said they were paid about $3,000 a month in Ukrainian currency, roughly in line with the salaries of local soldiers.
At the front, they said they found a very different war from those they had known against insurgents.
Close combat with automatic weapons in densely covered terrain was replaced by bombardment in exposed areas. And they could not count on the air superiority they enjoyed in Colombia for airstrikes or evacuations.
After arriving in Ukraine in February, Barrios told his wife that the fighting was more dangerous than he had expected.
He decided to go to Ukraine after the bank threatened to repossess his house weeks after his wife, Cubillos, gave birth to their third child. His nurse's salary could not cover the loan payments, Cubillos said.
Barrios died in a missile strike after 20 days at the front, too soon to earn even one paycheck.
Under Ukrainian law, families of servicemen killed in combat are supposed to receive a payment of $411,000. But Cubillos said she lacked the money for a lawyer or a plane ticket to travel to Ukraine to file the compensation claim in person.

Pessimism is growing in Ukraine. Has the war with Russia reached a stalemate?

Full text: Last August, more than two months after Ukraine began its counteroffensive against Russian positions in the east, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan was asked about whether the war was degenerating into a stalemate. Sullivan's answer: no. "We do not assess that the conflict is a stalemate," he said at the time. "We are seeing (Ukraine) continue to take territory on a methodical, systematic basis."
Fast-forward to today, and the cautious optimism cited by U.S. officials has largely turned into worry -- worry that Ukraine's counteroffensive has stalled; worry that Russian President Vladimir Putin will be able to squeak out victory from the jaws of defeat; and worry that Kyiv's backers in the West, principally the United States, will not be able to sustain Ukraine's war effort for much longer.
The lingering doubt about Ukraine's future prospects is beginning to creep into the Ukrainian population as well. While much has been made about so-called war fatigue in Western capitals, a similar feeling is percolating in Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Dnipro and the small towns throughout the Donbas. There is a growing sense that the war will only get worse before it gets better, assuming it can get better.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy still has sky-high approval ratings compared with his counterparts in the U.S. and Europe, yet even his popularity is slowly dipping. According to the Kyiv International institute of Sociology, the Ukrainian public's trust in their government has declined by 35 percentage points since May. The Ukrainian people haven't given up, but they've become a lot more realistic about what may be in store over the coming winter.
So has Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the man ultimately responsible for commanding the Ukrainian war effort. Even the top commander isn't exactly beaming with braggadocio these days. Indeed, he even used the s-word -- stalemate -- to describe the current state of the war. "Just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate," he opined to the Economist last week. "There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough."
Those remarks aren't exactly a shock to those monitoring the war. Take a look at a battlefield map from early June, before Ukraine's counteroffensive commenced, and the disposition of forces is almost identical to what the map looks like today. Zaluzhny is right: There is no big breakthrough in the works. The Russian army may have long since exposed itself as an incompetent mess, but Russian forces have managed to partially replace lack of quality with mass and a whole ton of ordinance.
The Russians have turned the 600-mile-long front line into a European-style version of the Korean Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone, with miles upon miles of land mines, tank traps, machine gun nests and trenches. To the extent the Ukrainians have made territorial gains, they've been at the margins and have come at a very high cost in men and equipment. In some areas of the front line, the Ukrainians are back on defense; in Avdiivka and near Kupiansk, Russian forces are keeping Ukrainian troops busy with a near constant volley of artillery fire (Moscow has yet to capture either city).
We should be brutally honest: More than five months in, Ukraine's counteroffensive has failed. While many would undoubtedly take serious issue with this assessment, the evidence available is quite clear. The Ukrainians hoped to accomplish three major objectives: reach the Sea of Azov, cut Russian-occupied territory in two and squeeze the Crimea Peninsula to the point where Putin concluded that maintaining control of the strategic peninsula was too costly. Not a single one of these objectives has been accomplished. Ukrainian policymakers and military officers will now have to make a choice about whether doubling down on their current strategy will increase the chances of success or whether an alternative plan, perhaps the consolidation of land the Ukrainian army already possesses, is a wiser course.
Whichever decision the Ukrainian government takes will determine the scope and direction of the war over the coming months. Regardless, Zelenskyy and his top advisers are clear about one thing: Even broaching the subject of peace talks with the Russian occupiers is unacceptable. "We don't want to make any dialogue with terrorists," Zelenskyy declared on NBC's "Meet the Press" over the weekend. "And the president of the United States and Congress, bipartisan support, all these people, they know that I am not ready to speak with the terrorists because their word is nothing."
The question then arises: If Zelenskyy isn't ready to talk to the Russians now, when will he be ready? During the war's first month, Ukrainian and Russian officials actually did sit down in an attempt to find a way out before the going got tough. Of course, those sessions didn't amount to anything. Outside of a few prisoner exchanges, contact between Kyiv and Moscow has since been kept to an absolute minimum. Zelenskyy's position has hardened as the war has trudged on, and Putin, eyeing what will be a tumultuous election season in the United States, will likely hold all of his options in reserve until he knows who the next president of the United States is going to be.
Wars end one of two ways: One side vanquishes the other on the battlefield or the combatants agree that an acceptable compromise is more advantageous to them than more fighting. The inability of the Russians and Ukrainians to make major advances in the field makes the first scenario highly unlikely. Yet, leaders on both sides have still not reached the point in which end-of-war diplomacy is a realistic possibility. Ukrainians should therefore brace for an even harsher winter.

Full text: The Russian military said a Ukrainian missile strike on a shipyard in annexed Crimea had damaged a Russian ship, and its military on Sunday reported a successful test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to carry nuclear warheads from a new nuclear submarine.
The Russian Defense Ministry said late Saturday that Ukrainian forces fired 15 cruise missiles at the Zaliv shipyard in Kerch, a city in the east of the Crimean Peninsula. Air defenses shot down 13 missiles but others hit the shipyard and damaged a vessel, a statement from the ministry said.
The ministry didn't give details about the ship or the extent of the damage.
The Ukrainian air force commander, Mykola Oleshchuk, said in a statement that at the time of the attack carried out by Ukrainian tactical aviation, "one of the most modern ships of Russia's Black Sea fleet was at the shipyard -- carrier of the Kalibr cruise missiles."
He didn't say directly, however, that this particular ship was damaged by the strike.
The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, has been a frequent target since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine 20 months ago. Crimea has served as the key hub for the invasion.
Ukraine has increasingly targeted naval facilities in Crimea in recent months. In September, a Ukrainian missile strike on a strategic shipyard in the port city of Sevastopol damaged two Russian ships and wounded 24 people. Later that month, a missile strike blasted the Crimean headquarters of Russia's navy in Sevastopol.
Commenting on Saturday's strike, the head of Ukraine's presidential office Andriy Yermak said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning that "life constantly proves that there won't be (Russia's) Black Sea fleet in Crimea."
In Moscow, the reported test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile comes as tensions are soaring between Russia and the West over the fighting in Ukraine. Adding to those tensions, Putin last week signed a bill revoking Russia's ratification of a global nuclear test ban in a move that Moscow said was needed to establish parity with the United States.
The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Imperator Alexander III strategic missile cruiser fired the Bulava missile from an underwater position in Russia's northern White Sea, and hit a target in the far-eastern region of Kamchatka. It wasn't immediately clear from the statement when the test launch occurred.
The Imperator Alexander III is one of the new Borei-class nuclear submarines that carry 16 Bulava missiles each.
Also, the Ukrainian military said a Russian missile killed troops and injured civilians in the Zaporizhzhia area late Friday. A video on social media claimed the strike landed on troops honoring fellow soldiers.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces targeted Ukraine overnight with their biggest drone attack in weeks, part of what Ukrainian officials and military analysts say appears to be a campaign to wear down and test Ukrainian air defenses before winter.
Ukraine's air forces said Russia had used some 40 kamikaze drones and a cruise missile, adding that they had shot down the missile and more than half of the drones. Their account could not be independently verified. No casualties were reported, but local officials said infrastructure facilities as well as residential and administrative buildings were hit by falling debris that caused large fires.
"As winter approaches, Russian terrorists will try to cause more harm," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said in a post on social media. His posts included a video of firefighters dousing a huge blaze. Zelenskyy said air defenses had been at work in 10 regions, including in areas far from the front line, such as the western Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.
Data from the Ukrainian military shows that Russia has recently increased its drone assaults against Ukraine, targeting it with nearly 650 Iranian-made Shahed drones in the past two months, compared with about 450 in July and August.
Military analysts and Ukrainian army officials have said the attacks are probably aimed at testing Ukrainian air defenses as winter looms, before what Ukrainian authorities have warned will be another Russian air campaign against the country's energy grid.
Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, said on national television last week that Russian drones were maneuvering across the country to determine where they can most easily break through air defenses. "This allows the enemy to draw conclusions about the forces and means in a particular region and take this information into account when planning future attacks," Ihnat said.
Ukraine has a limited number of air defense systems at its disposal, meaning that some areas of the country are better protected than others. While Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, has withstood most attacks this year thanks to powerful Western-supplied Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries, other cities have proved more vulnerable.
On Friday, Oleh Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city in the east, said drone attacks had partly destroyed a school, a car repair shop and a residential building. In the west and south, local officials said Russian drones had hit several facilities.
The drone assaults are also forcing Ukraine to burn through expensive stocks of surface-to-air missiles to shoot down Shahed drones, which are relatively cheap.
Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskyy's office, noted that a greater number of Shahed drones had been involved in recent attacks. "The battle for the sky is what awaits us," he said.
Ukraine has used its own fleet of cheap drones to evade and target Russian air defense systems.
Rybar, a Russian military blogger who has closely tracked the war, said Friday that 15 Ukrainian drones had been launched overnight at Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow illegally annexed in 2014 and that has increasingly been targeted by Ukrainian forces this year. His account could not be independently verified.
In an essay published this week, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the chief of Ukraine's armed forces, stressed the need to improve drone technology to break what he described as a "stalemate" in the war.
Zaluzhny's sober assessment of the state of the fighting has prompted debate in Ukraine, with some officials calling for a change in tactics.
On Friday, Zelenskyy dismissed the head of Ukraine's special operations forces, Gen. Viktor Khorenko, and replaced him with Col. Serhii Lupanchuk. The announcement did not offer details about Lupanchuk's background.
Still, what worries many people in Ukraine is not the increase in Russian drone assaults, but the drop in missile strikes. Russia fired only 24 missiles at Ukraine last month, about a quarter of the monthly number fired in September and August, according to the Ukrainian air force.
That has stoked fears that Moscow is saving its stockpiles of missiles to pound Ukraine's power stations and heating systems when the winter cold starts to bite. "It's disturbing -- they are saving their forces, their power to start some really big shelling," said Iryna Zadorozhna, 30, a resident of Kyiv.

Full text: Israel, under attack from murderous Hamas terrorists, needs American financial and military support, even as the beleaguered civilian population of Gaza deserves humanitarian help: Republicans in Congress entirely agree with President Biden and Democrats there. They are all together on the urgency to send assistance to Israel battling against Hamas.
Where Republicans break with Biden -- or at least a significant slice of them under the thrall of former President Donald Trump do -- is in also aiding Ukraine, which has been under brutal attack from Russia for a year and eight months. Against all expectations, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rallied Ukrainians to fend off Moscow's invasion.
The consequences are quite clear: Should America give up on Ukraine, Ukraine will fall to Vladimir Putin's forces, and the message will be clear that the strong can gobble the weak even when the world says no. The message will be sent that despite endless strident statements about how morally unacceptable it is for one country to invade a sovereign neighbor, if you wait long enough -- less than two years -- the world will lose its will and accept the supposedly unacceptable. ...
New Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is intent on separating the two requests for foreign aid, Israel and Ukraine. Moreover, Johnson proposes paying for the aid to Israel by slashing tens of billions of dollars in funding for more robust IRS enforcement, an asinine, ideologically motivated push that will forfeit much more revenue than it "saves." ...
Either Johnson and Republicans should accept a single, combined bill helping Israel and Ukraine alike in their moment of need, or they should commit to bringing both bills to the House floor, even if that means their passage will depend in part on Democratic votes.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- With the front line in Ukraine having barely shifted despite months of fierce fighting, Ukraine's top commander has acknowledged that his forces are locked in a "stalemate" with Russia and that no significant breakthrough was imminent, the most candid assessment so far by a leading Ukrainian official of the military's stalled counteroffensive.
"Just like in the First World War, we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate," the commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, told The Economist in an interview published Wednesday. "There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough."
It was the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse, although Zaluzhny added that breaking the deadlock could require technological advances to achieve air superiority and increase the effectiveness of artillery fire.
He added that Russian forces, too, are incapable of advancing.
The general said modern technology and precision weapons on both sides were preventing troops from breaching enemy lines, including the expansive use of drones, and the ability to jam drones. He called for advances in electronic warfare as a way to break the deadlock.
"We need to ride the power embedded in new technologies," he said.
The general also said he underestimated Russia's willingness to sacrifice troops in order to prevent a breakthrough and prolong the war.
"That was my mistake," he said. "Russia has lost at least 150,000 dead. In any other country such casualties would have stopped the war."
His accounting of Russia's casualties could not be independently verified.
His remarks come at a fraught time for Ukraine in its nearly 20-month battle against invading Russian forces. Western-supplied weapons have not enabled Ukraine to push through Russian defenses, and there are few weapons left that can make a difference.
The willingness of Western allies to sustain support for Ukraine is ebbing, including in the United States, where some Republicans in the House are balking at providing more aid.
Ukrainian officials are also worried that the war between Israel and Hamas will both divert the West's attention from Ukraine and siphon off weapons supplies that could be used in the fight against Russia.
The Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, said Thursday that the war was "not in a stalemate" and that Russian troops would continue to press forward on the battlefield.
Zaluzhny's comments came amid a wider effort by Ukrainian officials to temper allies' expectations of rapid battlefield success.
On Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the outside world was "accustomed to success" and complained that Ukrainian troops' achievements were "perceived as a given."

War widows look to life after loss: Women, Ukraine face mounting toll, vast 'scale of grief'

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine -- Maria and her husband, Artem, dreamed of visiting the Grand Canyon.
Alyona and Ilya fantasized about building a bar, with a stage for local musicians.
Yulia and Oleksandr talked about taking a road trip in the mountains.
Their dreams endure. But now, as war widows, Maria, Alyona and Yulia are being encouraged by a support group to consider pursuing them alone, as a way to deal with their grief about the deaths of their spouses in battle and to reintegrate themselves into society.
Among the many grim statistics of war -- soldiers killed or wounded, territory lost and retaken, rockets fired and buildings destroyed -- is the number of widows left behind. In Ukraine, where almost 20 months of fighting has settled into a grinding counteroffensive in which progress has been measured in yards rather than miles, that somber total grows daily.
Ukraine closely guards the number of its soldiers who have been killed, a figure it considers a national security secret. U.S. officials have suggested at least 70,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. If true, that means Ukraine may now be a country with tens of thousands of new widows.
"Our society was not ready to face such scale of grief," said Maria Verbovska, 33, who had planned to visit the Grand Canyon with her husband, Artem, who died last year in the siege of Mariupol. "I do not know what to do with my feelings for him."
For any country, coping with war requires understanding and addressing the needs of potentially thousands of widows.
On the other side of this war, in Russia, that has included frustrations with the government over a lack of information about missing loved ones, and over payments to survivors.
In Ukraine, support groups sometimes try to focus on balancing disparate needs: educating society to accept bereaved people and urge widows to resume, and hopefully enjoy, normal lives.
Those who have lost loved ones in war often freeze in their feelings, said Viktoria Herashchenko, a co-founder of a support group for Ukrainian war widows.
They may stop paying attention to everyday events like family gatherings and stop reading the news, she said. They may forget about food, and even about their own children. Simple daily events, such as seeing a happy family in a grocery store or a father playing with children at a playground, can become powerful triggers. And even the strongest relationships can fray.
The initiative that created a support group for Ukrainian war widows is called I Live, My Love. It is one of a dozen or so.
Herashchenko, a psychologist, had experience helping Ukrainian army families since 2014, when Russia first intervened militarily in Ukraine. After the full-scale invasion by Russian forces in February 2022, she made widows her sole focus.
Yulia Fatyeeva, 43, a decade older than her husband, Oleksandr Khokhlov, said she didn't think they would marry.
"But he proved to me that he was very reliable," she said. "And we both really wanted a baby."
When she learned that Khokhlov had been killed in a tank battle, she said she lost consciousness. She still finds it hard to believe he is gone.
"In the coffin he didn't look like himself," she said. After the funeral she dreamed of him. "He stood up and told me, 'I'm alive, don't cry, I'm good,' " Fatyeeva said.
Widows, according to those running support groups, often have a sensation that their dead spouses are still with them. It is a feeling that I Live, My Love acknowledges in its counseling by encouraging its members to hold on to the dreams they once shared as couples, and to do so without the sense that they must leave their partners behind.
Each support group meets weekly for eight weeks and then once a month, to preserve a tie with others who have endured the same kind of loss.
"It is important not to leave the women behind, but always be here for them," said Herashchenko, the co-founder.
In the front-line city of Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, participants in I Live, My Love sessions are encouraged to re-adapt to being in society by spending time in group activities. They breathe together in yoga. They do one another's makeup. They hike.
They begin, with the help of counselors and other members, to begin to see a future for themselves.
Alyona Prokopenko, whose husband, Ilya, was killed in trench fighting on the southern front last year, has had an idea for the bar they had planned to open. She will decorate it with printed quotations from what she remembers her husband saying.
Fatyeeva said she plans to fix the blue car she and Oleksandr shared and drive it with their daughter on a mountain road.
Verbovska is considering making that trip to the Grand Canyon.
"I will see it for both of us," she said.
