Full text: JERUSALEM -- Four more hostages kidnapped on Oct. 7 were declared dead by the Israeli military -- including three older adults seen in a Hamas video begging to be released.
Monday's announcement heightens pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a U.S. cease-fire proposal that could secure the return of the hostages still held in Gaza and end the eight-month war.
About 80 hostages in Gaza are believed to be alive, along with the remains of 43 others.
Since the Biden administration announced its cease-fire proposal Friday, Israel has seen some of its largest protests calling on the government to bring them home. Smaller protests took place nationwide. Although Biden said the proposal was Israeli, the Israeli leadership has appeared to distance itself from the plan, vowing to keep conducting military operations against Hamas until the militant group is destroyed.
All four of the men declared dead Monday night -- Nadav Popplewell, Amiram Cooper, Yoram Metzger and Haim Peri -- were kidnapped and taken into Gaza still alive, according to the Hostages Forum, a grassroots group representing the hostages' families.
"It is time to end this cycle of sacrifice and neglect," the group wrote in a statement following the announcement. "Their murder in captivity is a mark of disgrace and a sad reflection on the significance of delaying previous deals."
The group called on the government to immediately approve the cease-fire plan.
Three of the men declared dead Monday had female relatives who were released during an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners in November.
Cooper, Metzger and Peri were all 80 or older. Popplewell was over 50.

Full text: JERUSALEM -- Despite an international court order to stop its assault on Rafah, Israel says it will continue its operation, trying to walk a line between not angering its U.S. allies too much while trying to achieve strategic aims that it considers too important to abandon.
For now, after many weeks of admonitions from the White House, Israel and the United States are characterizing this as a "limited operation," allowing the Israelis to proceed, although more slowly and cautiously than they had in other parts of the Gaza Strip.
But as the fighting pushes masses of panicked civilians toward areas near the sea with inadequate housing or medical aid, and the closing of the Rafah border crossing dims hope for speedy delivery of humanitarian aid, Israel's critics abroad condemn the toll on civilians and are unconvinced by what the Israelis have called restraint.
On Friday, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah, saying it endangered the civilian population there, but did not call for a complete cease-fire. Israel says it will not halt its military operation.
For Israel, taking Rafah and the border would effectively complete the reconquest of Gaza and could mean a move to a different phase of lower-intensity raids. Rafah has in and under it the last four relatively organized Hamas battalions, a major tunnel infrastructure and rocket launchers, the Israelis say. More important, Israel wants to try to seal the border with Egypt to reduce the smuggling of weapons for the future.
"The airstrikes are continuous and intense, and the smell of smoke doesn't leave the air," said Mohammad al-Masri, 31, an accountant who has been sheltering in a tent in Rafah for months. "At night, they advance a few meters at a time, and the people flee immediately."
He spoke from western Rafah, where residents and other Gaza civilians who took refuge there have not yet been ordered by the Israeli military to leave. Even so, all around him many of the tents that had been sheltering families for months are gone as people have fled elsewhere.
"They shoot and bomb us constantly," he said, "but what scares us the most are the drones."
Israel's military aims remain unaltered, however. It wants to secure the entire border with Egypt, destroy the smuggling tunnels that had fortified Hamas, dismantle the last Hamas battalions, bring its remaining hostages home and break Hamas' administrative control over all of Gaza.
Israeli troops have concentrated initially on securing the border, which is lightly populated, circling around Rafah city and pressing the nearly 1 million people displaced from other parts of Gaza to move to areas that are supposed to be safer but where conditions remain dire.
Pushing slowly from the east, the Israeli military said Thursday that troops were fighting in the neighborhoods of Brazil, near the border, and Al-Shaboura refugee camp, their deepest penetration into Rafah. But they insist that they have not yet tried to enter the central city, which in normal times has a population close to 1 million people.
Analysts say the anger and warnings from the Biden administration and other close allies of Israel have had an effect in moderating Israeli tactics, even if the assault remains devastating.
In interviews, officers who have just left the fighting in Rafah say Israel is moving more deliberately and that it is using less air power and artillery, and fewer, smaller bombs, forcing Israeli soldiers to engage in urban guerrilla warfare with Hamas fighters.
With the U.S. insisting that Israel evacuate civilians as much as possible from planned zones of military operation, in the past two weeks as many as 1 million panicked civilians have moved west toward the sea and safer areas, even if facilities to house, feed and care for them are inadequate.
An Israeli officer in the reserves, who has just returned from southern Gaza and is not authorized to speak to the news media, said the military was using noticeably less air bombardment, and that troops were advancing slowly west in a pincer movement, with one division working near the border and the other moving into Rafah's outskirts.
The Biden administration had refused to support Israel's move on Rafah unless it saw a credible plan to evacuate and protect civilians. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said after his trip last weekend to Israel that, so far, the Israeli army was not violating American red lines in Rafah.
"What we have seen so far in terms of Israel's military operations in that area has been more targeted and limited, has not involved major military operations into the heart of dense urban areas," Sullivan said.
"We now have to see what unfolds from here. We will watch that, we will consider that, and we will see whether what Israel has briefed us and what they have laid out continues or something else happens."
Israel insists that it has heeded U.S. criticism and is trying to warn civilians to move out of the way of the fighting. But even if the civilians are not in the line of fire, the threats to them remain grave, with little or no aid crossing from Egypt.
Israel seized the Rafah crossing in what it said was a limited operation against Hamas, effectively closing it. Israel has said it would like to reopen the crossing, but its move on Rafah was not sufficiently coordinated with Egypt, which has demanded that Israel abandon its attack and pull back from the crossing before it can be reopened.

Full text: President Joe Biden's criticism of the International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to apply for arrest warrants for those responsible for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and Gaza is unwise and undermines U.S. credibility.
Last week, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced that he was applying for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders and two Israeli officials relating to the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel by Hamas and Israel's response. This conflict has roiled the international community and deeply traumatized Israelis and Palestinians.
Biden called the prosecutor's application for arrest warrants "outrageous" and suggested that it indicated some kind of "equivalence" between Israel and Hamas. Nothing could be further from the truth. International criminal law never compares people to each other; it compares people's actions to legal rules.
While today the U.S. objects to the possibility of ICC investigations into the situation in Gaza, justice is not a pick-and-choose system. The law must be applied impartially to all. The U.S. should not stand behind the court when it issues warrants against U.S. adversaries such as Russia and then seek to retaliate against it for pursuing warrants in a situation in which a U.S. ally is concerned.
This issue is not new to the ICC. The state of Palestine formally became a party to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, in January 2015. (We use the term "state of Palestine" in line with the legal terminology used by the ICC.) In May 2018, Palestine asked the ICC prosecutor to investigate possible crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In February 2021, the ICC found that it had jurisdiction over "Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem." Legally, this means the ICC currently has the power to investigate and prosecute alleged atrocity crimes committed by anyone in those areas, plus any crimes committed by Palestinian nationals outside those areas, including in Israel.
In recent years, the ICC has confronted opposition to its work, and the U.S. has shown that it can be a force for justice and accountability. Take the situation in Ukraine. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ICC prosecutor's investigation into atrocity crimes there, Congress made it easier for the U.S. to provide information to the ICC, and members of both parties criticized the Department of Defense for not cooperating more with the ICC.
Eventually, Biden ordered the Pentagon and others to fully cooperate with the ICC. The U.S. recognized the ICC's obvious independence and competence, and the ability of the U.S. to play a positive role in international criminal justice even though it is not a state party of the ICC. In contrast, Russia has attempted to intimidate the ICC prosecutor, to no avail. Khan has been indicted by the Russian Federation for requesting an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged atrocity crimes against Ukrainian civilians, a move widely denounced but one that has not affected the prosecutor's pursuit of justice in any way. Biden called the ICC arrest warrant for Putin "justified" and applauded the move.
The ineffective and misguided U.S. response to the situation in Afghanistan should not be the precedent the U.S. follows this time. In response to the ICC's investigation into atrocity crimes in Afghanistan, members of Congress threatened the ICC and its personnel. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump actually imposed sanctions against ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her aides. A public outcry ensued in the United States and abroad. Eventually, the sanctions were the subject of two lawsuits in the United States, one of which granted a temporary restraining order on the grounds that the sanction order was so sweeping in its provisions that its application was in likely violation of the First Amendment. The sanctions (which were dropped under the Biden administration) backfired.
While they undeniably inconvenienced the ICC prosecutor, ICC investigators were undaunted in their work and the ICC's reputation was strengthened, not diminished, as they continued to do their jobs despite U.S. pressure. Indeed, in that instance, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that while the U.S. disagreed with the ICC's investigation in Afghanistan, the best way to address U.S. concerns was through dialogue, not sanctions.
Likewise, the threat of sanctions around the investigation into the situation in the state of Palestine clearly has not daunted Khan, who has demonstrated courage and independence. Khan and his team knew the risk of U.S. opposition and took it anyway because the job that they accepted was to be independent and impartial in the pursuit of their mandate. As the independent panel of experts that reviewed the evidence underlying the prosecutor's application recently wrote, there are reasonable grounds to support the allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the proposed arrest warrants. Moreover, as they note, the law being applied is "humanity's law, not the law of any given side," that protects all the victims of this conflict and "all civilians in conflicts to come."
To be sure, there will be many difficult issues ahead if the ICC investigation proceeds. It is far too early for us to take a position on these issues. But we are certain that all parties, prosecution, defense and victims, will have every opportunity to make their case in the ICC.
As Gen. Wesley Clark wrote in his critique of the Trump sanctions, the "United States benefits from its leading role in developing and complying with international law and from the institutions that help enforce that law."
The United States must not try to manipulate the rule of law to benefit itself or its allies. Experience has shown that this is not only wrong, but it is also unproductive. The ICC -- an independent, permanent judicial institution whose only mandate is to pursue the worst international crimes -- must be left alone to do its work free from interference or threats.

Full text: It was an unusual gathering. Amid a torrential downpour, two high-ranking University of Notre Dame officials and a handful of student organizers huddled under a tree late at night. The students had attempted to erect a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus May 2. Now, they hoped to negotiate.
Four reporters with the university’s student newspaper, the Observer, watched from afar. They were soaking wet from hours in the rain. They were also the only journalists on campus, where pre-clearance is required for outside media.
“In that moment, it was very much like, ‘We need to document this story,’” said junior Isa Sheikh, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief. “We were the only outlet on the ground.”
When 17 students were arrested later that night, the Observer was the first to break the news. They worked in their office until 4 a.m. the next day.
“Staying up all night in the midst of finals wasn’t great,” Sheikh said with a laugh. “But for me, the first priority is the paper and our coverage of the campus.”
Student journalists across the Midwest and the country have been thrust into the spotlight as protests against the Israel-Hamas War engulfed universities. With firsthand campus knowledge, they have provided some of the most detailed, compelling coverage of the movement that swept the country.
In Chicago, Palestine solidarity encampments have been assembled at Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and DePaul University, with students demanding divestment from financial assets tied to Israel. The DePaul encampment stood for 17 days before it was cleared Thursday. Meanwhile, U. of C. students briefly occupied a campus building Friday during the school’s alumni weekend. The student newspapers at all three universities have continuously posted live updates, offering minute-by-minute coverage of the unrest rocking their campuses.
“I don’t think you can understate the importance of the student press,” said Roger Boye, an associate professor emeritus-in-service at Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism. “They’ve outmaneuvered the professional press, in many of these cases.”
The reporting has been applauded at a national level. The Pulitzer Prize Board — which is housed at Columbia University, the site of the first solidarity encampment — released a statement May 1 recognizing “the tireless efforts of student journalists” covering protests while facing “great personal and academic risk.” On the front lines, student reporters have been assaulted at UCLA and arrested at Dartmouth College.
Senior Lilly Keller was acutely aware of the risk on the fifth day of DePaul’s encampment, reporting at the center of a bitter clash with counterprotesters. Chicago police flanked the crowd on both sides, spilling into the street. She watched as students climbed the towering campus gates, unfurling both Israeli and Palestinian flags. The tension was palpable.
“When I first got there, I was live-tweeting, and, like, crying,” said Keller, editor-in-chief of the DePaulia. “But just jumping in, and doing the best we can, that’s all we have.”
The DePaulia has struggled with staffing — only five reporters and editors have consistently been involved in the student newspaper’s recent coverage. When the encampment was first erected, the team took shifts to cover 12-hour days. They set up a makeshift media tent across from the demonstration, with the word “press” scrawled across in black marker.
More than two weeks in, their reporting has blurred into midterms and family events.
“It’s been a lot,” Keller said. “But for me, and I think for other members of the DePaulia, it’s really rooted in our commitment to being journalists and our love for what we’re doing.”
Weeks earlier, the Daily Northwestern staff anticipated escalation. Editor-in-chief Jacob Wendler solicited advice from student journalists at Columbia and Vanderbilt University who had already grappled with demonstrations.
It paid off. When students and faculty descended on Deering Meadow on April 25, the Daily already had a detailed reporting plan. Two reporters were to remain at the encampment at all times, with an editor on-call. About two dozen students were involved with coverage in total.
“In terms of the workload, it was much more intense than anything we’ve experienced in the past,” said Wendler, a junior. “It was a new level of constant breaking news.”
On the first day, the Daily posted more than a hundred live updates. They also broke several stories throughout the demonstration, including the resignation of seven members of Northwestern’s President’s Advisory Committee on Preventing Antisemitism and Hate.
“Because student journalists are part of the communities that they cover, and also have unparalleled access to their peers and their campuses, we were able to get a really different and much more nuanced picture of what’s happening,” Wendler said.
Wendler, as well as Sheikh of the Observer, instructed staffers to write their editors’ phone numbers on their wrists in case of arrest. At the May 2 protest, Notre Dame police had repeatedly told Observer reporters to leave the scene. They refused.
“It was funny because it was raining so hard that the phone numbers were smudging,” Sheikh said. “For a solid 20 minutes, I was ready for my night in jail.”
It was jarring for a group that had attended classes just hours before. Now, they were assuming the role of professional journalists in a tense encounter with police.
“The job they have undertaken is not an easy one,” Boye said. “They have gone the extra mile. Democracy is the critical underpinning of what we’re doing in journalism”
There’s also the dual challenge of reporting on other students. Those involved with the encampments and counterprotests may be the faces of peers, classmates, friends.
On a recent afternoon, DePaulia news editor Lucia Preziosi, a junior, sat on a bench near the center of the university’s encampment before it was cleared. The quad was quiet — only a few demonstrators had emerged from their tents, kicking a soccer ball back and forth. She waved to a few of them.
“Some of my best friends are here,” Preziosi said, gesturing to the tents. “It adds to the difficulty of ethically covering something like this. But it also motivates me to want to report on this more. There are people I care about on both sides, and they want their story told.”
The live updates page on the DePaulia’s website became one of the most viewed stories in the newspaper’s history.
“Being a journalist in this has been the most amazing learning experience I’ve ever had in my life,” Preziosi said. “We have a certain connection to this place. And I think it shines through in our work.”

Student journalists across the Midwest and the country have been thrust into the spotlight as protests against Israel war on Gaza engulfed universities. With firsthand campus knowledge, they have provided some of the most detailed, compelling coverage of the movement that swept the country.
In Chicago, Palestine solidarity encampments have been assembled at Northwestern University, the University of Chicago
and DePaul University, with students demanding divestment from financial assets tied to Israel -- in response to its killing of more than 35,000 Palestinian civilians following Hamas' attacks on Oct. 7 that led to the killing of nearly 1,200 people, many of whom were civilians. The DePaul encampment stood for 17 days before it was cleared Thursday. Meanwhile, U. of C. students briefly occupied a campus building Friday during the school's alumni weekend.

Full text: JERUSALEM -- After Hamas attacked Israel in October and ignited the war in Gaza, Israeli leaders described the group's most senior official in the territory, Yehia Sinwar, as a "dead man walking." Considering him an architect of the raid, Israel has portrayed Sinwar's assassination as a major goal of its devastating counterattack.
Seven months later, Sinwar's survival is emblematic of the failures of Israel's war, which has ravaged Gaza but left Hamas' leadership largely intact and failed to free most of the captives taken in the October attack.
Even as Israeli officials seek his killing, they have been forced to negotiate with him, albeit indirectly, to free the remaining hostages. Sinwar has emerged not only as a strong-willed commander but as a shrewd negotiator who has staved off an Israeli battlefield victory while engaging Israeli envoys at the negotiating table, according to officials from Hamas, Israel and the United States. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments of Sinwar and diplomatic negotiations.
While the talks are mediated in Egypt and Qatar, it is Sinwar -- believed to be hiding in a tunnel network beneath Gaza -- whose consent is required by Hamas' negotiators before they agree to any concessions, according to some of those officials.
Hamas officials insist Sinwar doesn't have the final say in the group's decisions. But although Sinwar does not technically have authority over the entire Hamas movement, his leadership role in Gaza and his forceful personality have given him importance in how Hamas operates, according to allies and foes alike.
"There's no decision that can be made without consulting Sinwar," said Salah al-Din al-Awawdeh, a Hamas member and political analyst who befriended Sinwar while they were jailed in Israel during the 1990s and 2000s.
"Sinwar isn't an ordinary leader, he's a powerful person and an architect of events. He's not some sort of manager or director, he's a leader," al-Awawdeh added.
Sinwar has rarely been heard from since the start of the war, unlike Hamas officials based outside Gaza, including Ismail Haniyeh, the movement's most senior civilian official. Although he is nominally junior to Haniyeh, Sinwar has been central to Hamas' behind-the-scenes decision to hold out for a permanent cease-fire, U.S. and Israeli officials say.
Waiting for Sinwar's approval has often slowed the negotiations, according to officials and analysts. Israeli strikes have damaged much of Gaza's communications infrastructure, and it has sometimes taken a day to get a message to Sinwar and a day to receive a response, according to U.S. officials and Hamas members.
For Israeli and Western officials, Sinwar has over the course of these negotiations, which stalled again in Cairo this past week, emerged as a brutal adversary and a deft political operator, capable of analyzing Israeli society and appearing to adapt his policies accordingly.
As an architect of the Oct. 7 attacks, Sinwar masterminded a strategy that he knew would provoke a ferocious Israeli response. But in Hamas' calculus, the deaths of many Palestinian civilians -- who do not have access to Hamas' subterranean tunnels -- were the necessary cost of upending the status quo with Israel.
U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have spent months assessing Sinwar's motivations, according to people briefed on the intelligence. Analysts in both the United States and Israel believe that Sinwar is primarily motivated by a desire to take revenge on Israel and weaken it. The well-being of the Palestinian people or the establishment of a Palestinian state, the intelligence analysts say, appears to be secondary.
Sinwar was born in Gaza in 1962 to a family that had fled its home, along with several hundred thousand other Palestinian Arabs who fled or were forced to flee during the wars surrounding the creation of the state of Israel.
While in prison, Sinwar learned Hebrew and developed an understanding of Israeli culture and society, according to fellow former inmates and Israeli officials who monitored him in prison. Sinwar now appears to be using that knowledge to sow divisions in Israeli society and heighten pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, according to Israeli and U.S. officials.
They believe that Sinwar has timed the release of videos of some Israeli hostages in order to spur public outrage at Netanyahu during crucial phases of the cease-fire talks.
A senior Western official familiar with the cease-fire negotiations believes that even if negotiators seal a cease-fire deal, Israel is likely to pursue Sinwar for the rest of his life.

Full text: As Palestinian flags fluttered in the wind outside the Daley Center downtown, Rama Atieh described her father's experience of becoming a refugee when he was just 1 year old.
"Their lives as refugees were never the same. The flavors of the sea, and those olives and figs were a distant memory, and the sense of belonging -- elusive," she said. "Never again did my father or his parents glimpse over the hills of East Jerusalem."
Atieh spoke in front of hundreds in the Loop Saturday afternoon, many of whom wore keffiyehs and waved small Palestinian flags. Chicago's chapter of American Muslims for Palestine, an organization that advocates for and educates about Palestine, held their annual flag-raising ceremony to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the 76th anniversary of Palestinians' mass displacement from what is now Israel in 1948.
Palestinians refer to this exodus as the Nakba, or "catastrophe." An estimated 700,000 Palestinians, a majority of the prewar population, fled or were expelled from what is now Israel in the months before and during the war surrounding its creation, in which Jewish fighters fended off an attack by several Arab states.
"The Nakba is the reason why the majority of my mom's family reside in Jordan. The Nakba is the reason why I was born in Kuwait," said Atieh, a board member with AMP. "The Nakba is the reason why I can't take my children to visit the village I'm from. The Nakba is the reason why my father and his siblings live in different parts of the world."
Amid the mounting death toll in Gaza, Atieh said Palestinians are "again living through the pain of displacement -- this time live-streamed through our phones and TV screens."
More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, as Israel ordered new evacuations Saturday in the southern city of Rafah as it prepared to expand its military operation. Israel launched its bombardment of Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, where the group killed some 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.
Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, commended pro-Palestine student protesters at the Saturday rally, saying they are "looking into history, and they're not looking the other way, but they're taking action ... despite the police repression."
"Students, time after time, have been on the right side of history," he said.
The only remaining pro-Palestine encampment in Chicago is at DePaul University, after Chicago police arrested nearly 70 protesters at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and university police raided one at the University of Chicago. In rarer instances, schools including Northwestern University, have struck ​​agreements with protest leaders to restrict the disruption to campus life and upcoming commencement ceremonies.
President Joe Biden has defended the right to protest but insisted that "order must prevail" at college campuses, as some in Chicago's Jewish community demanded action at local universities to prevent hate speech.
"The universities of today function as businesses, not as schools," said Anuj Agarwal, an organizer with Students for Justice in Palestine at U. of C. "Schools don't raid encampments at 4:30 in the morning for protesting genocide, and schools don't fund genocide, apartheid, scholasticide and occupation."
"This is why you see students all over the world setting up encampments after over half a year of protesting -- universities largely haven't budged an inch, so we will keep fighting until our universities meet our demands," he continued. "We will keep fighting until our universities sever every tie and divest every dollar that funds and enables the occupation."
U. of C.'s president Paul Alivisatos said in a statement after the raid that "safety concerns (had) mounted" and that the "risks were increasing too rapidly for the status quo to hold." He said organizers' demands for the university to disclose its investments and divest from those with ties to Israel or weapons manufacturers were "fundamentally incompatible with the university's principled dedication to institutional neutrality."
After the speeches, those in the audience turned to watch a large Palestinian flag go up between the American and Chicago flags. Many cheered and took videos on their phones while music played in the background. Afterward, they marched on North Dearborn Street, chanting "Free Free Palestine."
Noor Shadid, a senior in high school, also read a poem she wrote titled "The Tears of Our Trees."
"The world is trying to erase, but the flag flies everywhere, in every time, in every place. Our flag flies high with strength and great grace," Shadid said. "Flying over the same lands trying to get it replaced, in every corner of the world."
"One day it'll fly in space, and today the city of Chicago is gonna come face to face with the red of our martyrs, the white of our peace, the black of our oppression and the green of our trees," she continued.

Full text: About 50 to 100 people have been gathering weekly at Skokie’s Village Green Park to protest and demand that Hamas release hostages kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to the group’s co-organizer, Alan Kotlyar.
About 60 people gathered on Sunday afternoon and marched for nearly a mile in downtown Skokie before reuniting at Village Green Park. The group chanted peace songs, demanded the release of Israeli hostages, and waved the American and Israeli flags. According to Kotlyar, the German and Argentinian consulates sent flags to the group in support of its cause because some of the hostages were citizens of those countries.
Sunday’s march occurred without incident, and Kotlyar said that’s how the protests usually go since he has been doing them, starting in December. He said the group has grown from seven people on its first march to upwards of 100 people and includes people with a diverse set of political opinions, but are united in demanding that Hamas releases its hostages.
“All we care about is that hostages should not be used as weapons of war,” Kotlyar told Pioneer Press. “You can’t take innocent, regular, random innocent people and just hold them in tunnels for months, years on end, as a form of some kind of like a political statement. It’s wrong.”
When asked about the World Health Kitchen workers being killed by an Israeli attack, Kotlyar said their killing by the Israeli military was “a very tragic mistake, but people forget the war was started by Hamas… None of this would ever have happened if Hamas hadn’t abducted those people. It’s very sad… but what other option does Israel have to bring (hostages) home?”
Regarding accusations of Israel killing innocent people, Kotlyar said, “the amount of precautions Israel does have on innocent civilians is just amazing” when compared to other armies.

Pro-Palestine protests sweep across area's college campuses: Students demand schools divest from Israel

Full text: A wave of pro-Palestine protests swept across the Chicago area's college campuses Friday, with hundreds of students calling for their schools to divest from funds connected to Israel or those that profit from its war in Gaza.
At Northwestern University's Evanston campus, demonstrations continued for a second day at Deering Meadow, a popular common area on campus. More than 40 tents covered the encampment -- three times as many as Thursday -- as some students studied, worked on laptops and read books.
Meanwhile, student organizers from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College and Roosevelt University staged a walkout in solidarity with Gaza downtown. And at the University of Chicago in Hyde Park, students marched on the main quad. No protesters were arrested at any of the demonstrations, as of Friday evening.
Protest encampments have popped up at dozens of college campuses across the U.S. and Canada, including Loyola University in Rogers Park, after beginning at New York's Columbia University last week. Some schools have negotiated with students, while others called in law enforcement to douse demonstrations, leading to mass arrests and, at times, violent clashes with police.
As the death toll mounts in the war in Gaza -- more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Health Ministry -- and the humanitarian crisis worsens, students have demanded schools cut financial ties to Israel.
Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, where the group killed some 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.
Northwestern students want 'all eyes on Gaza'
Students and activists associated with the Northwestern Divestment Coalition started the "Northwestern Liberation Zone" Thursday morning, taping signs to the fence surrounding the protest with messages such as "All eyes on Gaza." Many spent the night in tents.
No citations had been issued as of Friday afternoon, a campus spokesperson said. No classes were canceled Friday either.
As rain began to fall Friday afternoon, students protected tents with tarps and directed a steady flow of donated supplies, from chips and cookies to prayer mats and pizza. Around half the crowd lined up for afternoon prayers led by Palestinian civil rights activist and Muslim scholar Imam Omar Suleiman, as two campus police cars sat nearby.
"Don't move. Don't move from the side of truth. Don't move from the side of justice," he said before leading the crowd in prayers. "Plant our feet firm and put in our hearts what is necessary to be fortified so that we are never intimidated, never scared, never broken."
Some Jewish students say the protests have made them afraid to set foot on campus. Northwestern Hillel, the university's Jewish center, said the encampment reflected "a disturbing and quickly escalating trend of antisemitic rhetoric and actions both nationally and on our own campus."
Senior administrators met with demonstrators Thursday evening to "ensure the safety of members of the Northwestern community while also providing a space for free expression," a university spokesperson told the Tribune. The university told students they could continue to assemble as long as they remove tents and stop using bullhorns and speakers, an offer they declined, a statement posted to the school's website said.
First-year student Alexandra Hoffmann said she heard that conversations about disclosing the university's investments were "not very productive." She added that a core group of protesters were committed to staying overnight at the camp while other supporters came and went.
"A lot of people were very upset so that's adding fuel to the fire," Hoffmann said.
Universities, including Northwestern, use endowments invested in companies, private equity and hedge funds to pay for things such as research and scholarships. Northwestern's endowment fund is invested in a "widely diversified pool of assets," according to its website. Students are pushing the school to drop any investments in companies with ties to Israel and weapons manufacturers. Private institutions such as Northwestern aren't required to provide detailed financial information.
Northwestern administrators abruptly changed a campus policy Thursday morning to ban tents and other temporary structures in common areas, saying students violating the policy risked suspension, expulsion or criminal charges, according to a statement on the school website.
There was a brief encounter Thursday morning between protesters and cops, who warned students to take down tents or face citations. But they eventually left to monitor the protest from nearby buildings.
At a protest Thursday afternoon, roughly four dozen Loyola students called on the school to reinstate a student representative to its board of trustees so students can access the school's financial portfolios and understand whether it has invested money with companies that profit from war. Campus security watched the sit-in from a distance, but did not attempt to stop it.
Walkouts at three schools
Hundreds of students from the School of the Art Institute, Columbia and Roosevelt walked out of classes Friday afternoon, gathering in Millennium Park to express support for Palestine and other campus demonstrations.
As rain came down, the crowd clutched handmade signs and posters beside the Bean. Organizers chanted through a microphone and raised a large banner on the steps that said "Free Palestine" in red letters.
The Tribune did not see counterprotesters on the scene, but dozens of police officers watched from afar on North Michigan Avenue. A Chicago police spokesperson said there were no arrests. All three schools did not respond to requests for comment.
Jordan Daniels, a recent Art Institute graduate, was dripping wet from hours in the rain. The student encampments across the Chicago inspired her,, she said.
"It's very exciting to see that young people are stirring things up," Daniels said. An organizer added that many attendees planned to join the Northwestern encampment after the protest.
SAIC students Felix Severino, 26, and Julia Fetters, 22, stood toward the front of the crowd, cheering the speakers.
"The genocide has been happening for way too long. It shouldn't have been happening in the first place," Fetters said. "Just seeing three schools in Chicago get together, it's like, 'Hell yeah, we're gonna make some noise.'"
U. of C. students call for a 'free Palestine'
Meanwhile Friday afternoon, more than 100 students and activists marched in the rain on the University of Chicago's main quad, shouting "Free, free Palestine" and "Up up with liberation! Down with the occupation."
Organizers spoke about the importance of divesting university funds from institutions with ties to Israel. The protest lasted about two hours, ending around 4 p.m. A U. of C. spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Students said the movement for Palestinian liberation on campus has grown in the past six months with 13 campus organizations asking for divestment and full transparency on endowments.
"I am a marginalized student," said Alexis Paredes, a senior at U. of C. "On a campus in which so much of our money goes to investing in weapons manufacturing. ... I feel like it's not in my heart to be complicit."

Full text: For many Jews, the first Passover since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack holds special significance.
Carol Cohen visited Chicago from London for the holiday.
"I feel guilty being here, all dressed up with these lovely people, we're going to have a wonderful evening, and our brethren, the hostages, God knows what's happening to them," Cohen said. "And I feel as a Jew, as a proud Jew ... I just feel that I should be here, we have to embrace every holiday otherwise they've won."
Cohen was among the dozens of practicing Jews to observe the first night of Passover Monday evening at a Seder at a hotel in the Gold Coast neighborhood, celebrated by Rabbi Meir Chai Benhiyoun of the Chabad Center for Jewish Life in downtown Chicago. Armed security was present at the door.
Passover commemorates ancient Israelites' exodus from slavery in Egypt. Observant Jews will gather with family and friends at the Seder to recount the Moses-led escape from captivity. Some avoid eating grains, known as chametz, in remembrance of their ancestors who fled Egypt with no time to wait for bread to rise.
More than 200 people were taken hostage by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack that left 1,200 Israelis dead.
In the months since, the Israel Defense Forces have carried out strikes targeting Hamas, killing more than 34,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Meanwhile, concerns over antisemitism and Islamophobia have surged in Jewish and Muslim communities across the United States.
Eva, a 14-year-old girl from Oak Park, attended Monday's Seder with her mother. She shared with the Tribune that she's faced harassment at school in the months since the Oct. 7 attack.
"It's very hard to be my age during this. It's very divided. A lot of people want to tell me what to think because of my age, and (I) don't know what I'm talking about," said Eva, whose mother declined to share their family surname. "They'd rather have Hamas in this world than have Jews, and that's really hard."

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO -- Google fired 28 workers Wednesday after dozens of employees participated in sit-ins at the company's New York and Sunnyvale, California, offices to protest the company's cloud computing contract with the Israeli government.
A day earlier, nine employees were arrested on charges of trespassing at the two offices.
"Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior," a Google spokesperson said.
Years before the dismissals, tensions had been simmering between the company's management and some activist employees over Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion Google and Amazon deal to supply cloud services, such as artificial intelligence, to the Israeli government.
That discord had deepened since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip began in October. Google recently fired an employee who disrupted an Israeli technology conference in New York. And the company is planning to make changes to a corporate forum because employees were bickering about the conflict.
Google said it would continue to investigate the Tuesday protests. In Sunnyvale, employees refused to leave the office of Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud.
Google employees affiliated with the group that organized the sit-ins, called No Tech For Apartheid, said in a statement that the firings were "a flagrant act of retaliation."
"Google workers have the right to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our labor," the employees said. They added that some of the employees Google fired had not participated in the sit-ins.
The Nimbus contract, announced in 2021, is meant to supply various Israeli government ministries with cloud software. A Google spokesperson said Nimbus "is not directed at highly sensitive, classified or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services."

Full text: Though largely thwarted by Israel and its allies, the assault launched by Iran against the Jewish state over the weekend was a powerful reminder that the Tehran regime remains the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. Israel's security would be best served now through resolve and restraint, rather than military escalation.
Iranian leaders tried to portray Saturday's attack as a proportional response to a presumed Israeli strike that killed a top Iranian commander and several advisers in Damascus, Syria, on April 1. ...
In military terms, Iran's attack was a failure. Israeli and US forces, with help from the UK, France, Jordan and possibly some of Israel's other Arab neighbors, shot down an estimated 99% of the incoming missiles and drones, most of them before they reached Israeli airspace. Rather than reinforcing Israel's isolation, the attack illustrated how strong its alliances remain despite anger over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza. ...
Like any state, Israel reserves the right to respond to a direct assault on its territory. But a tit-for-tat strike on Iran would cast Israel once again as the aggressor, jeopardizing the support of Europe and even the U.S. Meanwhile, the war in Gaza is far from finished, with top Hamas leaders still free and more than 100 Israeli hostages in captivity. The border with Lebanon remains unsettled, preventing thousands of Israelis from returning to their homes in the north. After months of fighting, Israel's military is stretched. ...
Most important, restraint would allow Israel and its supporters to capitalize on the moment, not least by reminding Arab neighbors where their true interests lie. The failed strikes underscore the danger Iran poses to them as well as to Israel. ...
Israel's long-term security requires peaceful relations with its neighbors, including the Palestinians, coupled with containment of Iran and its proxies. Rigorous and assertive diplomacy is needed to accomplish those objectives and prevent a wider war.

Full text: A top U.S. military commander traveled to Israel on Thursday, officials said, as fears rise that Iran would soon launch a strike to avenge the killings of several senior commanders.
Iran's leaders have repeatedly vowed to punish Israel for an April 1 strike in Syria that killed several senior Iranian commanders. U.S. officials have said they are bracing for a possible Iranian response, and Israel has put its military on alert.
A day after President Joe Biden warned that Iran was threatening a "significant" attack, Defense Department officials said that the top American military commander for the Middle East, Gen. Michael Kurilla, arrived in Israel.
The general went to Israel to coordinate on what is expected to be imminent retaliatory action by Iran, as well as to discuss the war in the Gaza Strip, Defense Department officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The Israeli military's spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Kurilla had carried out a situational assessment and reviewed "regional security challenges" with the Israeli military's chief of staff.
"We are highly alert and ready to face various scenarios," Hagari said in a televised news briefing, adding that any strike from Iranian territory would be a clear regional escalation.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Thursday that Israel was facing "challenging times," noting that "in the midst of the war in Gaza" his country was "also prepared for scenarios involving challenges in other sectors."
"We have determined a simple rule: Whoever harms us, we will harm them," he said, using language that in recent days has been used to refer to threats from Iran and its proxies.
While Biden has become increasingly critical of Netanyahu's conduct of the war in Gaza -- threatening to withhold U.S. assistance unless Israel does more to protect civilians -- he emphasized Wednesday that American support for Israel in the face of an Iranian threat was unconditional.
"As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad," he said at a news conference.
As Iran and Israel have traded fresh threats in recent days, diplomats have been trying to reduce tensions and avert a wider regional war.
The foreign minister of Germany, Annalena Baerbock, spoke to her Iranian counterpart "about the tense situation" in the Middle East on Thursday, according to her office.

Full text: Naperville elected leaders acknowledged continued cries for a local Gaza ceasefire resolution at the City Council meeting Tuesday night, but still would not formally take up the issue.
Yet again this week, community members from Naperville and surrounding suburbs packed the Naperville City Council chambers and spoke on the local impact of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More than 50 people spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting.
And has been the case for the past month and a half of council meetings, pleas that Naperville elected officials issue a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire in the conflict were repeated Tuesday.
The persistence spurred council members to finally speak on the matter — most for the first time on the dais — but comments did not beget any sort of action by the end of the meeting.
As the chambers cleared, some audience members threw out calls of “shame!” and “cowards” towards the council.
Since February, the public comment period of Naperville council meetings has been dominated by requests for a ceasefire in Gaza. And for the most part, council members have left those requests unaddressed — publicly at least.
At a meeting last month, Mayor Scott Wehrli, breaking his silence on the issue, announced that to “be clear, the City Cuncil does not intend to initiate a ceasefire resolution” because the situation “is clearly outside the scope of our local municipal government.”
His announcement triggered such vocal opposition from audience members that the council meeting was paused for 10 minutes. Days after, pro-Palestinian graffiti and flyers were found along the Naperville Riverwalk. Maintenance staff from the Naperville Park District took steps to remove it.
Tuesday night, Councilman Benny White acknowledged that “our residents are hurting.”
“I know you’re hurting,” he said. “Our Palestinian … our Jewish brothers and sisters, I know you’re hurting.”
Those both for and against a ceasefire resolution addressed the council this week. While at previous meetings ceasefire comments have primarily concerned pushing for a resolution, a large contingency of those against the idea also turned out Tuesday, including a number from the Congregation Beth Shalom in Naperville.
“The council has no impact or expertise in the longstanding, intractable conflict in the Middle East,” David Eber, rabbi of the synagogue, said to elected leaders. “Diplomats in foreign policy, mavens … have tried for years to broker solutions to this conflict, and I think it is foolish to think that our resolution will have any impact.”
Still, pro-ceasefire speakers remained resolute.
“My neighbors and I are not … asking you to engage in international diplomacy, to contact foreign governments or to send humanitarian aid,” said Salex Khalid, of Aurora. “We’re asking you to support a ceasefire resolution that addresses an issue of great personal concern to your constituents.”
White apologized for not speaking on the issue in any prior meetings. Though noting that “there’s been a lot of discussions off the dais,” he also said that, “I know you’re wanting to hear something from your council.”
He assured his interest in continuing “the conversation to see what we can do to ease this burden on our community.” However, White also acknowledged that his focus is on Naperville issues.
Councilman Patrick Kelly offered similar remarks.
“I know there’s been very little feedback from the dais over the past many council meetings, which I think is in part because we’ve honestly never dealt with something like this, at least I haven’t in my five years on the council,” he said.
Kelly said he thought it was “important to acknowledge the stories that we’ve heard because they are heartbreaking” but again, like White, pulled the focus back to the city.
“I have argued many times over the past five years that I’ve been up here,” Kelly said, “that as a body, our council should only consider resolutions of this nature if there is widespread consensus in a way that brings our council and our city together … (but) I don’t think we have yet arrived at that point.”
Council members Allison Longenbaugh, Nate Wilson and Ian Holzhauer each also spoke on the matter Tuesday, extending sympathies but also heeding that the situation ought to be addressed by a higher level of government.
“What I’ve been doing is calling my representatives, both as a constituent and as a councilwoman, to tell them about these meetings and to ask them to prioritize getting aid in,” Longenbaugh said. “It’s at their level where this should be discussed and where it should be resolved.”

Full text: Naperville elected leaders acknowledged continued cries for a local Gaza ceasefire resolution at the City Council meeting Tuesday night, but still would not formally take up the issue.
Yet again this week, community members from Naperville and surrounding suburbs packed the Naperville City Council chambers and spoke on the local impact of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More than 50 people spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting.
And has been the case for the past month and a half of council meetings, pleas that Naperville elected officials issue a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire in the conflict were repeated Tuesday.
The persistence spurred council members to finally speak on the matter — most for the first time on the dais — but comments did not beget any sort of action by the end of the meeting.
As the chambers cleared, some audience members threw out calls of “shame!” and “cowards” towards the council.
Since February, the public comment period of Naperville council meetings has been dominated by requests for a ceasefire in Gaza. And for the most part, council members have left those requests unaddressed — publicly at least.
At a meeting last month, Mayor Scott Wehrli, breaking his silence on the issue, announced that to “be clear, the City Cuncil does not intend to initiate a ceasefire resolution” because the situation “is clearly outside the scope of our local municipal government.”
His announcement triggered such vocal opposition from audience members that the council meeting was paused for 10 minutes. Days after, pro-Palestinian graffiti and flyers were found along the Naperville Riverwalk. Maintenance staff from the Naperville Park District took steps to remove it.
Tuesday night, Councilman Benny White acknowledged that “our residents are hurting.”
“I know you’re hurting,” he said. “Our Palestinian … our Jewish brothers and sisters, I know you’re hurting.”
Those both for and against a ceasefire resolution addressed the council this week. While at previous meetings ceasefire comments have primarily concerned pushing for a resolution, a large contingency of those against the idea also turned out Tuesday, including a number from the Congregation Beth Shalom in Naperville.
“The council has no impact or expertise in the longstanding, intractable conflict in the Middle East,” David Eber, rabbi of the synagogue, said to elected leaders. “Diplomats in foreign policy, mavens … have tried for years to broker solutions to this conflict, and I think it is foolish to think that our resolution will have any impact.”
Still, pro-ceasefire speakers remained resolute.
“My neighbors and I are not … asking you to engage in international diplomacy, to contact foreign governments or to send humanitarian aid,” said Salex Khalid, of Aurora. “We’re asking you to support a ceasefire resolution that addresses an issue of great personal concern to your constituents.”
White apologized for not speaking on the issue in any prior meetings. Though noting that “there’s been a lot of discussions off the dais,” he also said that, “I know you’re wanting to hear something from your council.”
He assured his interest in continuing “the conversation to see what we can do to ease this burden on our community.” However, White also acknowledged that his focus is on Naperville issues.
Councilman Patrick Kelly offered similar remarks.
“I know there’s been very little feedback from the dais over the past many council meetings, which I think is in part because we’ve honestly never dealt with something like this, at least I haven’t in my five years on the council,” he said.
Kelly said he thought it was “important to acknowledge the stories that we’ve heard because they are heartbreaking” but again, like White, pulled the focus back to the city.
“I have argued many times over the past five years that I’ve been up here,” Kelly said, “that as a body, our council should only consider resolutions of this nature if there is widespread consensus in a way that brings our council and our city together … (but) I don’t think we have yet arrived at that point.”
Council members Allison Longenbaugh, Nate Wilson and Ian Holzhauer each also spoke on the matter Tuesday, extending sympathies but also heeding that the situation ought to be addressed by a higher level of government.
“What I’ve been doing is calling my representatives, both as a constituent and as a councilwoman, to tell them about these meetings and to ask them to prioritize getting aid in,” Longenbaugh said. “It’s at their level where this should be discussed and where it should be resolved.”

Full text: Chicago Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan said he doesn’t want to wade into political debate after drawing backlash for speaking in front of a “Solidarity with Israel” banner during the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Spirit of Courage Gala.
DeRozan was awarded a Medal of Valor during Wednesday’s ceremony in Skokie. Bulls President and CEO Michael Reinsdorf was also onstage for the medal presentation.
In a brief speech, DeRozan spoke about “giving inspiration and hope” to fans through basketball. He stood on a podium in front of two Israeli flags and a “Solidarity with Israel” banner, evoking strong responses from NBA fans on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
During a news conference after practice Thursday at the Advocate Center, DeRozan said his presence at the event did not reflect any personal beliefs about the ongoing war.
“My whole career, I’ve never gotten involved with the politics side of things,” DeRozan said. “That’s just never a thing that I’ve ever really touched on or spoke on. I went there for the reason I went there for. We’re all going through something as people, as a country, as a world that we’re all battling, that we’re all trying to figure out and trying to get through at the end of the day.”
Before a road game against the New York Knicks in January, DeRozan was approached by Yoav Modai, an NBA reporter for Israel’s Sport 5 network. Modai asked DeRozan to sign a jersey in honor of his friend Oron Beilin, a 24-year-old Bulls fan who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas at Kibbutz Be’eri. After DeRozan posed for a photo and signed the jersey, Modai sent it to Beilin’s family in Israel.
Months later, DeRozan was contacted by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international organization focused on “fighting anti-Semitism, defending Israel’s legitimacy and protecting the safety of Jews worldwide.” The Midwest chapter is based in Skokie and recently collaborated with groups such as the Women’s Zionist Organization of America.
DeRozan said he signs “countless jerseys” throughout the season, and Wednesday’s honor was a reminder of the impact each interaction can make on an individual fan.
DeRozan received the medal for signing a jersey after a road game in New York for Oron Beilin, who was killed in the Hamas attack at a music festival last October.

“I didn’t think too much of anything from it,” DeRozan said. “Fast forward to now, being honored for a deed that I did months ago for a family just speaks volumes.
“For me, it just was a matter of me doing something nice for somebody that I didn’t know, a person that was grieving, that was going through something. They honored me with an award for just me being me.”

NBA players have largely avoided wading into the debate surrounding the Israel-Palestine war since violence escalated in October. The league and players association released a statement mourning “the horrific loss of life in Israel and condemn(ing) these acts of terrorism” in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, but neither has released any statements on the ongoing violence since.
Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving has been a vocal supporter of Palestine for years, and Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown wore a “Free Gaza” bracelet to a game in January. But the majority of the league has remained quiet about the conflict, which soon will enter its seventh month.
DeRozan elected not to add further context on his personal opinions of the war or his presence at Wednesday’s event. He reiterated that he didn’t wish to “get caught up in the politics side of things where you start bringing the negativity.”
But he did voice frustration with negative backlash from fans on social media to his reception of the medal.
“The negativity that comes with it, it comes with it,” DeRozan said. “At the end of the day, they ain’t going to stop me from doing whatever nice deed I could do for any person, any walk of life. You want to have any type of negative impression of that, that’s on you.
“For me, I’m going to continue to be myself. When I walk out of here, when I’m on the court, if I come across a kid that’s maybe going through something, a grieving father, anybody, I’m going to just be me. I don’t really get caught up in the other stuff because at the end of the day, we’ve all got a lot of stuff that we’ve got to unpack and we’ve all got to get through.”

Full text: Airstrikes killed a number of soldiers early Friday near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, Syria's state news media and an independent organization reported, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that tracks Syria's civil war, said that the dead included 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from the pro-Iranian militias. The group said the attack appeared to have hit multiple targets, including a weapons depot belonging to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia that Iran supports and has a presence in Syria.
The airstrikes stoked fears that have unsettled Western officials for months: that Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip could escalate into a broader conflict against Syria, Iran and its proxies across the region, which could entangle allies of those involved, like Russia and the United States.
American officials have sought to tamp down tensions, and Iran has tried to rein in its network of militias after a drone fired by one of the groups killed three U.S. Army reservists in January. But fears of a wider conflict have persisted as Israel and Hezbollah have clashed for months along the border, and as Israel has carried out assaults on Iran-linked targets in Syria.
Israel's military did not immediately comment on the Syria strikes Friday, but its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, appeared to hint at responsibility.
"We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks," he said on social media, promising more operations in Lebanon, Syria and "other more distant locations."
Iran supports and arms a network of proxy militias that have been fighting with Israel, including Hamas, whose political leader was in Iran for high-level meetings this week. Attacks across the borders of Lebanon and Syria have escalated since Oct. 7, when Hamas led a raid into Israel and the country responded with an intense bombardment and later ground invasion of Gaza.
The Israeli military said this month that its forces had struck more than 4,500 Hezbollah targets in Syria and Lebanon since Oct. 7. The assaults, it said, had killed over 300 Hezbollah members, though that could not be independently confirmed.
Texas voter fraud: A Texas appeals court has overturned a Fort Worth woman's voter fraud conviction and five-year prison term for casting an illegal provisional ballot.
Crystal Mason did not know that being on probation for a previous felony conviction left her ineligible to vote in 2016, the Second District Court of Appeals in Fort Worth ruled Thursday.
Appearing near tears at times, Mason said during a Friday news conference that it has been a long seven years since the voting charge. "I've been out for six years on an appeal bond, one foot in one foot out, not knowing if I was going back to prison," Mason said.
California cameras: Hundreds of high-tech surveillance cameras are being installed in the city of Oakland and surrounding freeways to battle crime, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday.
Newsom, a Democrat, said in a news release that the California Highway Patrol has contracted with Flock Safety to install 480 cameras that can identify and track vehicles by license plate, type, color and even decals and bumper stickers. The cameras will provide authorities with real-time alerts of suspect vehicles.
Opponents say the technology infringes on privacy and will lead to further police abuse of already marginalized communities.
But public safety remains a concern statewide, especially retail theft, forcing even liberal leaders of Democratic cities to embrace increased policing.
Moscow shooting: Nine people have been detained by Tajikistan's state security service over suspected contact with the perpetrators of last week's attack on a suburban Moscow concert hall that killed 144 people, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said Friday.
The reported arrests came a week after the massacre in the Crocus City Hall, in which gunmen also set the building on fire. The four suspected attackers were arrested and identified as Tajik nationals.
An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack.
RIA Novosti said Friday, citing an unnamed source in Tajikistan's security services, that those detained in the Central Asian country are suspected of having IS connections. Russian security forces were involved in the operation to detain them, according to the agency.
Northern Ireland politics: Northern Ireland's finely balanced power-sharing arrangements were thrown into disarray Friday as the leader of the region's largest unionist party stepped down after being charged with nonrecent sexual offenses.
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Democratic Unionist Party he was leaving his post due to the investigation and has been suspended from the party pending the outcome of the judicial process, the DUP said in a statement.
Donaldson, who has led the DUP since 2021, is the most powerful figure in Northern Ireland's unionist movement, which seeks to maintain the region's historic ties to the United Kingdom. His departure is likely to weaken the party as it prepares for U.K. parliamentary elections this year and maneuvers to fend off demands from the nationalist party Sinn Fein for reunification with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
South Africa bus crash: An 8-year-old girl was the lone survivor after a bus full of pilgrims making their way to a popular Easter festival in rural South Africa slammed into a bridge on a mountain pass and plunged more than 150 feet into a ravine before bursting into flames, killing all 45 others on board.
South Africa's roads become deadly during the Easter period, when millions crisscross the country. Authorities repeatedly warn motorists of the danger and had issued multiple messages urging caution just a day before Thursday's horrific crash.
The girl was in stable condition in the hospital after being admitted with serious injuries and was "in safe hands," an official with the local health department said Friday. Details of her injuries were not released.
Forensic investigators retrieved what they believed were 34 of the 45 bodies but couldn't be certain of the exact number, reflecting the gruesome nature of the crash. Many of the victims trapped inside the bus were burned beyond recognition, authorities said.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the victims, who appeared to all be from Botswana, were on their way to the rustic town of Moria in Limpopo province for the Easter weekend pilgrimage that attracts hundreds of thousands of followers of the Zion Christian Church.

Full text: Airstrikes killed a number of soldiers early Friday near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, Syria's state news media and an independent organization reported, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that tracks Syria's civil war, said that the dead included 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from the pro-Iranian militias. The group said the attack appeared to have hit multiple targets, including a weapons depot belonging to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia that Iran supports and has a presence in Syria.
The airstrikes stoked fears that have unsettled Western officials for months: that Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip could escalate into a broader conflict against Syria, Iran and its proxies across the region, which could entangle allies of those involved, like Russia and the United States.
American officials have sought to tamp down tensions, and Iran has tried to rein in its network of militias after a drone fired by one of the groups killed three U.S. Army reservists in January. But fears of a wider conflict have persisted as Israel and Hezbollah have clashed for months along the border, and as Israel has carried out assaults on Iran-linked targets in Syria.
Israel's military did not immediately comment on the Syria strikes Friday, but its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, appeared to hint at responsibility.
"We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks," he said on social media, promising more operations in Lebanon, Syria and "other more distant locations."
Iran supports and arms a network of proxy militias that have been fighting with Israel, including Hamas, whose political leader was in Iran for high-level meetings this week. Attacks across the borders of Lebanon and Syria have escalated since Oct. 7, when Hamas led a raid into Israel and the country responded with an intense bombardment and later ground invasion of Gaza.
The Israeli military said this month that its forces had struck more than 4,500 Hezbollah targets in Syria and Lebanon since Oct. 7. The assaults, it said, had killed over 300 Hezbollah members, though that could not be independently confirmed.
Texas voter fraud: A Texas appeals court has overturned a Fort Worth woman's voter fraud conviction and five-year prison term for casting an illegal provisional ballot.
Crystal Mason did not know that being on probation for a previous felony conviction left her ineligible to vote in 2016, the Second District Court of Appeals in Fort Worth ruled Thursday.
Appearing near tears at times, Mason said during a Friday news conference that it has been a long seven years since the voting charge. "I've been out for six years on an appeal bond, one foot in one foot out, not knowing if I was going back to prison," Mason said.
California cameras: Hundreds of high-tech surveillance cameras are being installed in the city of Oakland and surrounding freeways to battle crime, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday.
Newsom, a Democrat, said in a news release that the California Highway Patrol has contracted with Flock Safety to install 480 cameras that can identify and track vehicles by license plate, type, color and even decals and bumper stickers. The cameras will provide authorities with real-time alerts of suspect vehicles.
Opponents say the technology infringes on privacy and will lead to further police abuse of already marginalized communities.
But public safety remains a concern statewide, especially retail theft, forcing even liberal leaders of Democratic cities to embrace increased policing.
Moscow shooting: Nine people have been detained by Tajikistan's state security service over suspected contact with the perpetrators of last week's attack on a suburban Moscow concert hall that killed 144 people, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said Friday.
The reported arrests came a week after the massacre in the Crocus City Hall, in which gunmen also set the building on fire. The four suspected attackers were arrested and identified as Tajik nationals.
An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack.
RIA Novosti said Friday, citing an unnamed source in Tajikistan's security services, that those detained in the Central Asian country are suspected of having IS connections. Russian security forces were involved in the operation to detain them, according to the agency.
Northern Ireland politics: Northern Ireland's finely balanced power-sharing arrangements were thrown into disarray Friday as the leader of the region's largest unionist party stepped down after being charged with nonrecent sexual offenses.
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Democratic Unionist Party he was leaving his post due to the investigation and has been suspended from the party pending the outcome of the judicial process, the DUP said in a statement.
Donaldson, who has led the DUP since 2021, is the most powerful figure in Northern Ireland's unionist movement, which seeks to maintain the region's historic ties to the United Kingdom. His departure is likely to weaken the party as it prepares for U.K. parliamentary elections this year and maneuvers to fend off demands from the nationalist party Sinn Fein for reunification with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
South Africa bus crash: An 8-year-old girl was the lone survivor after a bus full of pilgrims making their way to a popular Easter festival in rural South Africa slammed into a bridge on a mountain pass and plunged more than 150 feet into a ravine before bursting into flames, killing all 45 others on board.
South Africa's roads become deadly during the Easter period, when millions crisscross the country. Authorities repeatedly warn motorists of the danger and had issued multiple messages urging caution just a day before Thursday's horrific crash.
The girl was in stable condition in the hospital after being admitted with serious injuries and was "in safe hands," an official with the local health department said Friday. Details of her injuries were not released.
Forensic investigators retrieved what they believed were 34 of the 45 bodies but couldn't be certain of the exact number, reflecting the gruesome nature of the crash. Many of the victims trapped inside the bus were burned beyond recognition, authorities said.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the victims, who appeared to all be from Botswana, were on their way to the rustic town of Moria in Limpopo province for the Easter weekend pilgrimage that attracts hundreds of thousands of followers of the Zion Christian Church.

Full text: JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military said Thursday that it is carrying out raids in and around two hospitals in the Gaza Strip, while the United Nations and aid groups expressed alarm for patients and medical workers there and warned of the rapidly deteriorating state of Gaza's health care system.
Fierce battles have been raging in and around Shifa Hospital, the largest in the strip, since an Israeli assault there began 10 days ago.
Meanwhile, the top United Nations court ordered Israel on Thursday to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including opening more land crossings to allow food, water, fuel and other supplies into the war-​ravaged enclave.
The International Court of Justice issued two new provisional measures in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its military campaign. Israel denies committing genocide, saying its military campaign is self-defense and aimed at Hamas, not the Palestinian people.
In its legally binding order, the court told Israel to take measures "without delay" to ensure "the unhindered provision" of basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.
The renewed fighting around the hospital underscores the problems Israel has had in maintaining control of
parts of Gaza that its forces have supposedly captured. So far, the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has not agreed on a detailed plan for governing the enclave.
The Israeli military said in a statement that nearly 200 people whom it called "terrorists" had been killed in the area and its troops had taken fire from militants inside and outside one of the hospital's buildings.
Gaza authorities said that over the course of the raid, more than 200 civilians had been killed and 1,000 had been detained. Neither claim could be independently verified. Israel says Hamas, the armed group that led an attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, is using hospitals in Gaza for military purposes, a claim that Hamas and hospital administrators have denied.
Witnesses have described days of fear as fighting has continued at the Shifa complex, with several patients dying as a result of the assault.
"We are constantly hearing strikes and gunfire day and night and seeing smoke rising from buildings," said Ezzeldine al-Dali, who lives less than a mile from Shifa. He said several homes in the area were set on fire by Israeli forces after their occupants evacuated. That claim could not be independently verified.
"The scale of destruction around us is indescribable," al-Dali, 22, said in a voice message Thursday. "The homes that have not been reduced to rubble have been burned."
Gaza's health system is "barely surviving," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, said Thursday. He called for "an immediate end to attacks on hospitals" and for the protection of medical staff, patients and civilians.
Israel initially raided Shifa Hospital in November and struggled to prove its early claim that Hamas maintained a command and control center beneath the site. Evidence examined by The New York Times suggests that Hamas has used the hospital for cover, stored weapons inside it and maintained a hardened tunnel beneath the complex.
The fact that the Israeli military's operation at the hospital and in the neighborhood has lasted longer than its November raid suggests that Hamas and allied groups have returned and built up a significant force there, perhaps in recent weeks, military analysts say.
That in turn suggests that Israel's strategy in north Gaza involves repeated raids in places where Hamas or other groups have reasserted themselves after Israeli forces have tried to clear them, according to military analysts.
But the problems Israel has faced in securing the hospital and its vicinity also raise the question of how easily Israel's military could eliminate the threat from Hamas without a long-term presence in Gaza or an alternative governing structure in the territory.
At least six Palestinian militias have participated in attacks targeting Israeli forces in and around Shifa, with more than 70 such attacks since the raid began March 18, according to an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a research group in Washington.
"This high rate of attack indicates that Palestinian militias retain a significant degree of combat effectiveness in the area, despite continued Israeli clearing efforts around Gaza City," according to the analysis, which did not elaborate on the nature of each attack.
The Israeli military said its forces were also continuing to operate around Al Amal Hospital and the town of Al-Qarara, in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza, and had killed dozens that it said were terrorists.
Al Amal went out of service Monday night after Israeli forces besieged it a day earlier and forced everyone inside to leave before closing off its entrances with earthen barriers, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, which runs the hospital.
"The loss of Al Amal is another blow to an already collapsing health system," the International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday. It added that thousands of people in need of medical treatment were not able to receive it.

Full text: JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military pressed on with its bombardment of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, signaling that the passing of a United Nations resolution calling for a cease-fire for the holy month of Ramadan the day before had not shaken Israel's determination to keep fighting.
The military said its fighter jets had struck "over 60 targets" in Gaza over the previous day. It added that its forces were also operating in central Gaza, where they had killed "a number of terrorists." Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's news agency, said Tuesday that the Israeli military had struck residential homes and buildings and that dozens of people were killed.
In a statement, the Israeli military added that it was continuing its "operational activity" around Al-Amal Hospital and the town of Al-Qarara, in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza, adding that its forces were "eliminating terrorists and carrying out targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure."
Al-Amal Hospital went out of service Monday night after Israeli forces besieged it a day earlier and forced everyone out before closing off its entrances with earthen barriers, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, which runs the hospital. The organization said Monday that two people were killed and three others wounded when Israeli forces opened fire as they were being evacuated.
The Israeli military also said Tuesday that it was pressing on with its assault on Shifa Hospital in the north for a ninth day. It said its forces there had "located weapons" and "eliminated several terrorists."
Ezzeldine al-Dali, who lives less than a mile from Shifa, said airstrikes and gunfire had intensified in the area Monday night before calming Tuesday morning, which residents took as a sign that Israeli forces had concluded their raid.
He said people he knew went to the hospital thinking the raid was over, but "they were wrong," and people were shot and wounded. His account could not be independently verified. The Israeli military said it was checking into it.
Israel has long accused Hamas, the armed group that led an attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, of using hospitals in Gaza for military purposes, a claim that Hamas and hospital administrators have denied.
A New York Times analysis found that Hamas had used the Shifa complex for military purposes. The Israeli military, however, has struggled to prove its claim that Hamas maintained a command-and-control center under it.
Al-Dali, 22, said that the passage of the U.N. resolution did not give him or those around him any hope that the Israeli bombardment would stop soon.
"The International Court of Justice, Biden and all the Arab and Western countries could not stop Israel," he said by phone Tuesday. "So why would the United Nations be able to stop them?"
The International Court of Justice in late January ordered Israel to ensure that its actions would not lead to genocide, and to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza. But the court did not order a halt to fighting in the Gaza Strip.

Full text: At least 30,000 people have been killed so far, famine is on Gaza's doorstep and children are dying of hunger. And yet, the U.S. government continues to rely on persuasion to urge Israel's government to change course. This strategy has failed dramatically.
U.S. officials have made clear that, while Israel's cause is just, its approach to this war has imposed unjustifiable suffering on the civilian population and undermined prospects for long-term peace and stability. If the U.S. government really wants this to change, it must stop blindly underwriting the war.
Officials in President Joe Biden's administration like to point out that steady pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delivered small results, but it's hard to take these claims seriously.
The U.S. government urged Israel to avoid a large ground invasion early on. Israel launched it anyway. It urged Israel not to carpet-bomb the south as it did in the north. It did anyway. The U.S. military urged Israel to use smaller, more precise weapons in Gaza's dense urban areas. Israel's military continued to drop unguided 2000-pound bombs anyway. The United States urged Israel not to conduct raids on hospitals. It did anyway.
The Biden administration has told Israel it must not reoccupy Gaza and must plan for an eventual two-state solution. Netanyahu has made crystal clear that his day-after plan is total occupation, and he openly scoffs at the idea of a Palestinian state.
Biden administration officials have repeatedly pleaded with Israel to allow enough lifesaving aid to enter Gaza to prevent famine and widespread outbreak of disease. And yet, the Israeli government has made it nearly impossible to deliver sufficient aid to a civilian population entirely within its control and at its mercy.
The Biden administration has stepped up its public criticism of Netanyahu's government. On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered the strongest words yet. "People in Gaza are starving," she said. "The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses."
In December, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned that the extremely high civilian casualty rate risked driving civilians "into the arms of the enemy," which would result in "a strategic defeat." Last month, Biden himself said Israel's military operations were "over the top."
But these statements mean nothing when directly contradicted by what the U.S. government continues to do: protecting Israel from consequences on the world stage and providing it with the military aid that makes continuing this war possible.
Only a few weeks ago, the United States once again stood alone in vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, and it has escaped no one that most bombs dropped in Gaza are from the United States. In only a few months, Israel has destroyed more of Gaza's infrastructure than three years of war did in Aleppo, Syria, putting Gaza's suffering at historic proportions.
That destruction is made worse by the dearth of humanitarian support. Thanks to Israel's obstruction, only a fraction of the aid needed is entering Gaza. The enclave's 2.3 million residents are in dire need of food, clean water and health care. Absent rapid changes to the humanitarian situation, hundreds of thousands will starve to death. It's no wonder then that the few distributions that occur turn into chaos.
The U.S. response was to airdrop about 38,000 meals into Gaza on March 2 and again on March 5 -- each an expensive and dangerous venture amounting to less than the contents of one full truck by some estimates. It was little more than a gesture to make conflicted senior officials feel better about the role they are playing in America's continued faux helplessness.
The United States is Israel's most important partner and advocate on the world stage. Israel is America's biggest recipient of military aid by far, to the tune of about $4 billion a year. It has received more than $300 billion in U.S. aid since its founding, more than 50% more than the next highest recipient. U.S. assistance accounts for some 15% of Israel's defense budget.
For Israel, this translates to a pretty significant dependence on the United States for its ability to wage war. But you wouldn't know it by how America is acting. Instead of using this leverage, the Biden administration has made clear that its support is unconditional.
The closest it has gotten to conditioning aid was a directive last month to authorize cutting off military aid to countries that violate international protections of civilians. But this is a cynical gesture since U.S. law already requires such, and this redundant provision is still not being applied to condition support to Israel.
With Netanyahu counting on this war to keep him in power, no amount of friendly cajoling is going to persuade him. He will not change course until refusing to do so costs him. The United States is uniquely positioned to impose that cost by making U.S. military assistance contingent on Israel heeding America's most urgent demands.
We have the leverage, and we have the laws. If we don't have the will, we will pay the costs, now and for a long time to come.

Full text: In a major shift, Israeli negotiators have signaled that Israel could release a group of high-profile Palestinian prisoners serving lengthy jail terms in exchange for the freedom of some of the Israeli hostages who are still in the Gaza Strip, officials say.
The change in Israeli negotiating strategy, which has not been announced publicly, is significant because it could help persuade Hamas to release Israeli soldiers captured in October and agree to a deal that would temporarily pause the fighting in Gaza.
International efforts to reach a truce had stalled over Israel's refusal to release Palestinians convicted of murder and to commit to a permanent cease-fire, two of the measures that Hamas is holding out for.
Now, Israeli negotiators have privately agreed to a U.S. proposal that would see five female Israeli soldiers released for 15 Palestinians convicted of major terrorism charges, according to two officials with knowledge of ongoing mediation efforts. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, which came during a meeting last week with officials from Egypt, Qatar and the United States in Paris.
The idea is seen as the basis for negotiations with Hamas, which has not responded to the proposal. The Israeli government had avoided such a concession because the release of Palestinians convicted of major acts of terrorism would attract domestic criticism.
Asked about the negotiators' position, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.
Other elements of a deal -- including the length of a cease-fire and Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal of Israeli military forces from Gaza -- are still under discussion.
Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes Monday inside Lebanon on targets associated with the Hezbollah militia hit deeper than any in recent years, targeting an area close to the Syria border.
The Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck Hezbollah air defenses in the Bekaa Valley, about 60 miles from the Israel border. It said the strikes were in response to a surface-to-air missile attack that downed an Israeli drone over southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for that attack.
At least two Hezbollah fighters were killed in the Israeli airstrikes and at least six people were wounded, according to Bachir Khodor, mayor of the nearby city of Baalbek.
Also Monday, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh of the Palestinian Authority, the body that administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, tendered the resignation of his Cabinet, according to the authority's official news agency.
The decision follows diplomatic efforts involving the United States and Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, to persuade the authority to overhaul itself in a way that would enable it to take over the administration of the Gaza Strip after the war there ends.

Full text: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels launched attacks Thursday on both Israel and a ship traveling through the Gulf of Aden, setting the vessel ablaze and again demonstrating their ability to launch assaults despite facing U.S.-led airstrikes targeting their forces.
The rebels' supreme leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, announced an "escalation in sea operations" conducted by his forces as part of what they describe as a pressure campaign to end Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis' targets have grown more random since their attacks began in November.
The attack Thursday in the Gulf of Aden saw two missiles fired at a Palau-flagged cargo ship named Islander, the U.S. military's Central Command said. A European naval force in the region described the attack as sparking a fire and wounding one sailor on board the vessel, though the ship is continuing on its way.
The Islander had been coming from Thailand bound for Egypt.
Meanwhile, sirens sounded early Thursday over the southern Israeli port of Eilat, followed by videos of what appeared to be an interception in the sky.
The Israeli military later said the interception was carried out by its Arrow missile defense system.
Israel did not identify what the object fired on was, nor where it came from.
The system "intercepted a launch which was identified in the area of the Red Sea and was en route to Israel," the Israeli military said. "The target did not cross into Israeli territory."
Eilat, a key Red Sea port city of Israel. The rebels have claimed other attacks targeting Eilat, which have not damaged the city.
Houthi Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attacks in a statement late Thursday.
In the United States, four foreign nationals were charged Thursday with transporting suspected Iranian-made weapons on a vessel intercepted by U.S. naval forces in the Arabian Sea last month. Two Navy SEALs died on the mission.
The criminal complaint was unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia.
Muhammad Pahlawan is charged with attempting to smuggle advanced missile components. He is also charged with providing false information to U.S. Coast Guard officers during the boarding of the vessel. His co-defendants -- Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufran Ullah and Izhar Muhammad -- were also charged with providing false information.
Saree also claimed a drone attack on a U.S. warship in the region. Central Command said it and an allied warship shot down six Houthi drones in the Red Sea.

Full text: A day after vetoing calls for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, the United States on Wednesday defended Israel's decadeslong occupation of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, arguing at the United Nations' highest court that Israel faced "very real security needs."
The latest U.S. defense of Israel on the global stage came at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, where Richard Visek, the acting legal adviser at the U.S. State Department, urged a 15-judge panel not to call for Israel's immediate withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory. He said that only the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel could bring about lasting peace, repeating a long-standing U.S. position but one whose prospects appear even more elusive amid the war in Gaza.
The court is hearing six days of arguments over the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian-majority territories, including the West Bank and east Jerusalem, which has been the subject of years of debates and resolutions at the U.N. The hearings -- involving more than 50 countries -- were called long before Israel went to war against Hamas in Gaza, but have become part of a concerted global effort to stop the conflict and examine the legality of Israel's policies toward Palestinians.
Israel has said it would not participate in the hearings, and sent a letter to the court last year arguing that they were unwarranted and failed to "recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens" or its right to security.
The United States has defended Israel during the war, including Tuesday, when it cast the lone veto against a U.N. Security Council resolution that called for an immediate cease-fire, saying it would disrupt efforts to free hostages held in Gaza.
On Wednesday, Visek asked the court to uphold the "established framework" for peace that he said U.N. bodies had agreed to -- one that is contingent on a "broader end to belligerence" against Israel -- rather than to heed calls by other nations for Israel's "unilateral and unconditional withdrawal" from occupied territories.
The Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel were a reminder of the threats facing the country and of its security needs, Visek said, "and they persist."
"Regrettably, those needs have been ignored by many of the participants in asserting how the court should consider the questions before it," he said, referring to others countries' testimony in the hearings.
Visek's appearance preceded that of Vladimir Tarabrin, Russia's ambassador to the Netherlands.
When he took the microphone, Tarabrin said Russia values its "stable relations" with Israel and expressed condolences over Oct. 7. But in what appeared to be a thinly veiled swipe at the United States, he said Russia "cannot accept the logic" of those who "try to defend the indiscriminate violence against civilians" in Gaza by citing Israel's right to defend itself.
The court, which often hears staid disputes among nations, has lately become a venue for countries to oppose Israel. Last month, South Africa argued at the court that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza -- a charge Israel rejected. The judges have not ruled on that claim, but issued an interim order for Israel to take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza.
After the hearings, which are scheduled to end Monday, the court will give a nonbinding advisory opinion, a decision that is expected to take several months.
In Gaza, Israeli strikes across the territory killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza.
Meanwhile, a member of Israel's War Cabinet said Wednesday that new attempts are underway to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that could pause the war in Gaza.
"Initial signs indicate a possibility of moving forward," said Benny Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister.
It's the first Israeli indication of renewed talks since negotiations stalled a week ago. However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Israel says Rafah, a city on the Egyptian border, is the last remaining Hamas stronghold after nearly five months of fighting.

Full text: President Joe Biden said he would be willing to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson to discuss an emergency funding package for Ukraine and Israel, after White House officials previously dismissed the utility of direct talks.
"I'd be happy to meet with him if he has anything to say," Biden told reporters Monday after returning to the White House from his weekend in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
The president's remarks are a signal the White House is intensifying its effort to secure passage for a $95 billion aid bill, which also includes funding for the Indo-Pacific and aid for Palestinian civilians.
Supporters of the package, which passed the Senate in a 70-29 vote, have argued the fall of the Ukrainian city of Avdiivka to Russian forces and the death last week of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a Siberian prison intensified the need for quick passage of the funding.
"We're making a big mistake not responding," Biden told reporters, adding that he hoped the death of Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin's most formidable domestic critic, would rally support behind the legislation.
Biden said he was considering new sanctions on Russia over Navalny's death.
The president's willingness to engage in one-on-one negotiations comes after his aides had cast such a session as unproductive last week, noting the Republican leader's shifting demands for a foreign aid bill.
Johnson, who clings to a narrow majority in the House, had insisted foreign aid funding be married to new border-control measures -- only to reject a bipartisan package negotiated in the Senate at the urging of former President Donald Trump, Biden's likely opponent in November's presidential election.
"What is there to negotiate? Really? Truly? What is the one-on-one negotiation about when he's been presented with exactly what he asked for? So, he's negotiating with himself. He's killing bills on his own," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.
Lawmakers are on recess so it's not clear when a meeting might be scheduled.

Full text: Israel carried out extensive and lethal airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Wednesday in response to a deadly rocket attack on northern Israel, escalations in recent fighting that threaten to derail diplomatic efforts to prevent a major expansion of the war in the Gaza Strip.
The rocket attack from Lebanon was the second in two days to cause casualties in northern Israel, striking a military base near the city of Safed -- beyond the border zone that Israel has evacuated for months because of the fighting.
A soldier was killed, the military said, identifying her as serving with Israel's border protection service. Eight other people were wounded, according to Magen David Adom, the emergency medical service.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion quickly fell on Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia allied with Hamas, the armed group Israel has been battling in Gaza for more than four months.
Hezbollah and Israel have launched dozens of tit-​for-tat strikes across the border, fueling fears that the exchanges could expand to a full-fledged second front in the war.
Within hours of the rocket attack, Israel's military said it had carried out strikes against "a series of Hezbollah terrorist targets," including compounds and control rooms.
Lebanese broadcasters showed images and videos of smoke plumes and destruction.
The state news agency reported that strikes hit at least eight areas, killing a woman and her two children.
Hezbollah said one of its fighters had also been killed, and a senior official with the group, Hashem Safieddine, vowed a response.
Meanwhile, international efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas suffered a setback Wednesday as Israel reportedly recalled its negotiating team and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of hobbling the high-stakes negotiations by sticking to "delusional" demands.
Netanyahu's remarks came hours after local media reported that the Israeli leader had ordered an Israeli delegation not to continue talks in Cairo, raising concerns over the fate of the negotiations and sparking criticism from the families of the roughly 130 remaining captives, about a fourth of whom are said to be dead.
The relatives of the hostages said Netanyahu's decision amounted to a "death sentence" for their loved ones.
The mediation efforts, steered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, have been working to bring the warring sides toward an agreement that might secure a truce in the monthslong war, which has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to local health officials.
The fighting has destroyed vast parts of Gaza, displaced most of the territory's population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe.
Hamas meanwhile said Netanyahu was to blame. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told The Associated Press that Israel had put forward a proposal that strayed from agreements reached during earlier cease-fire talks.
Israeli officials have warned repeatedly that they would take much stronger military action in Lebanon if the cross-border violence continued; Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and 2006 in response to such attacks.
The Israeli military's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, cautioned that "this is not the time to stop" striking Hezbollah -- which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran -- and warned that "there is still a long way to go."
Hezbollah has been equally defiant.
Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader, said Tuesday, "You escalate, we escalate."
The clashes between Hezbollah and Israel have displaced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since the war with Hamas began in October.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that the U.S. House will not feel "rushed" to pass the $95.3 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, signaling a further stall over sending military hardware and munitions that Kyiv badly needs to fight Russia.
Johnson made the remarks behind closed doors at a morning meeting of House Republicans, who are largely aligned with former President Donald Trump, the party's presidential front-runner, in opposing the Senate-passed aid for Ukraine's fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.
The speaker let colleagues know that the House will instead "work its will," in considering the package, said a person familiar with the private remarks and granted anonymity to discuss them.
"The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill," Johnson said at a news conference afterward.
Johnson, who rejected a border security compromise that was eventually stripped from the final product, said the Senate's package "does nothing" to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, which has been the GOP's priority.
The slow-walk of U.S. aid to an ally during the largest ground war in Europe since World War II shows how far Republicans have retreated from overseas leadership in line with Trump.
While Johnson has said he personally supports aid for Ukraine, he leads a far-right majority that is more closely aligned with Trump's isolationist ideology and, increasingly, a hands-off approach to Putin's aggression.
Biden has warned that refusal to take up the bill would be "playing into Putin's hands."
Georgia election case: A Georgia judge who is deciding whether to toss Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis off the state's election interference case against former President Donald Trump has set a hearing for Thursday that is expected to focus on details of Willis' personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.
As soon as allegations of an inappropriate romantic relationship between Willis and attorney Nathan Wade surfaced last month, speculation about the future of the case began to swirl. Even if the prosecution isn't derailed, the upheaval has certainly created an unwanted distraction for Willis and her team and could undermine public confidence in the case.
Onetime White House aide Michael Roman's motion says Willis and Wade were romantically involved when she hired him in November 2021 to manage an investigation into whether Trump and others committed any crimes as they tried to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. That investigation led to the indictment in August of Trump and 18 others who are accused of participating in a sprawling illegal scheme to keep Trump in office.
Four of the people charged have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the remaining 14 have all pleaded not guilty.
No ballot stuffing: A conservative group has told a Georgia judge that it doesn't have evidence to support its claims of illegal ballot stuffing during the 2020 general election and a runoff two months later.
Texas-based True the Vote filed complaints with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in 2021, including one in which it said it had obtained "a detailed account of coordinated efforts to collect and deposit ballots in drop boxes across metro Atlanta" during the November 2020 election and a January 2021 runoff.
A Fulton County Superior Court judge in Atlanta signed an order last year requiring True the Vote to provide evidence it had collected, including the names of people who were sources of information, to state elections officials who were frustrated by the group's refusal to share evidence with investigators.
In their written response, attorneys for True the Vote said the group had no names or other documentary evidence to share.
Iran pipeline blasts: Explosions struck a natural gas pipeline in Iran early Wednesday, with an official blaming the blasts on a "sabotage and terrorist action" in the country as tensions remain high in the Middle East amid Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The blasts hit a natural gas pipeline running from Iran's western Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province up north to cities on the Caspian Sea. The roughly 790-mile pipeline begins in Asaluyeh, a hub for Iran's offshore South Pars gas field.
Saeed Aghli, the manager of Iran's gas network control center, told Iranian state television that a "sabotage and terrorist" action caused explosions along several areas of the line.
There are no known insurgent groups operating in that province, home to the Bakhtiari, a branch of Iran's Lur ethnic group. Aghli did not name any suspects in the blasts.
Iran's Oil Minister Javad Owji, also speaking to state TV, compared the attack to a series of mysterious and unclaimed assaults on gas pipelines in 2011 -- including around the anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Tehran marked the 45th anniversary of the revolution Sunday.
Indonesia election: A former general linked to past human rights abuses claimed victory Wednesday in Indonesia's presidential election, a result that would raise questions about the commitment to democratic values in the sprawling island nation that is the world's third largest democracy.
Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, 72, presented himself as an heir to immensely popular sitting President Joko Widodo, whose son was his running mate.
Citing unofficial results, Subianto told thousands of supporters in the capital, Jakarta, that his victory was "the victory of all Indonesians."
There was no declaration by election officials, and the two former provincial governors who also competed in the balloting did not concede defeat.
Japanese moon craft: An unmanned spacecraft has captured and transmitted data analyzing 10 lunar rocks, a greater-than-expected achievement that could help provide clues about the origin of the moon, a Japan space agency official said Wednesday.
For four days, the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM -- which landed on the moon upside down Jan. 20 -- has used its multi-band spectral camera to study rock composition, and worked on examining lunar rocks, said Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency project manager Shinichiro Sakai.
The landing made Japan the world's fifth country to reach the moon, after the U.S., the Soviet Union, China and India.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Sunday pushed a $95 billion emergency aid bill for Ukraine and Israel past a critical hurdle, with a bipartisan vote that kept the legislation on track for passage within days.
The vote was 67-27 to move forward on the package, which would dedicate $60.1 billion to helping Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression, send $14.1 billion to Israel for its war against Hamas and fund almost $10 billion in humanitarian assistance for civilians in conflict zones, while addressing threats to the Indo-Pacific region.
In a rare Sunday session, 18 Republicans joined Democrats to advance the measure, which leaders hope the Senate will approve as early as Tuesday.
"It's no exaggeration to say the eyes of the world are on the United States Senate," Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, said on the floor Sunday, appealing to his colleagues to back the bill.
He maintained that U.S. allies "don't have the luxury of pretending that the world's most dangerous aggressors are someone else's problem, and neither do we."
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, said on the floor, "We're going to keep working on this bill until the job is done."
He commended Republicans who had backed the measure for "working in good faith to get this done" and asserted that it was "essential" for the Senate to pass the legislation. It had been decades, Schumer added, since Congress considered a bill "that so significantly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the very security of Western democracy and our ideals."
But steep hurdles still remain for the bill in the Republican-led House, where it faces staunch opposition fueled by the "America First" stance of former President Donald Trump.
The bipartisan endorsement in the Senate came over the bitter opposition of right-wing Republicans who have railed against the measure, contending that the United States should not be continuing to send tens of billions of dollars to bolster Ukraine's security, particularly without first doing more to secure its own border with Mexico against an influx of migration.
They have continued to make that argument even after voting last week to kill a version of the aid bill that included a border crackdown, saying it did not go far enough.
Many Republican opponents also have taken issue with the billions of dollars the bill would devote to humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, as well as $7.9 billion in economic aid to prop up Ukraine's domestic infrastructure during wartime.
"We did spend four months promising the American people that we would secure our own border before we focused on other countries' borders," Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said on "Fox News Sunday," adding that he also had "serious concerns about the $19 billion of nondefense aid in there."
Cotton voted last week with most of his party to kill the bipartisan border plan.
Trump has stoked the resistance, urging Republican lawmakers to reject the bipartisan border plan and egging on House GOP leaders, who promised that it would be dead on arrival in their chamber.
Trump has also made no secret of his opposition to funding Ukraine's military campaign to push back a Russian invasion, a stance he underscored during a campaign rally Saturday by suggesting that, if reelected, he would not defend U.S. allies against threats from Moscow if the allies did not pay for defense.
Trump described the United States' role in preserving the global democratic order as strictly transactional, declaring that if a NATO member failed to commit the requisite funds to bolster the organization's collective security, he would refuse to defend them against a Russian attack.
Of Russia, he added: "I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want."
NATO members are expected to commit at least 2% of their gross domestic product to military spending, a threshold that most of its member nations have not met.
Sunday's action amounted to a repudiation of Trump's stance by Democrats and a determined bloc of Republicans, led by McConnell, who have maintained that it is imperative that the United States continue to come to Ukraine's aid militarily to send a signal to the rest of the world's dictators.
"Deterrence is not divisible; American credibility is not divisible," Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said on the floor Friday, adding, "You can't say, 'We're going to be real strong in the Taiwan Strait, but you know -- no problem in Ukraine.' "
Democrats predicted that enough Republicans would ultimately reject Trump's pressure for the Senate to pass the measure.
"It has been hard to get Republican votes to support Ukraine, made very difficult by Donald Trump's opposition to Ukraine funding, but I think we're going to get this done," Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation."
He warned that the United States would be "on the precipice of a disaster" that could lead Russian President Vladimir Putin to threaten NATO allies if the Senate failed to pass the bill.
The bipartisan coalition that has carried the bill thus far will have to stick together for a few more votes before the Senate votes on approving the foreign assistance package and sending it to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is facing threats from the right to try to oust him if he puts a Ukraine aid bill on the floor.

Full text: Carpentersville police Chaplain Phil Zilinski will be one of several ministers heading to Israel this month to meet with police officers and their families involved in and affected by the Israeli war with Hamas in Gaza.
"This trip is not meant to be political but is a trip for a ministry of presence," Zilinski said.
The trip is being arranged by the International Conference of Police Chaplains of which Zilinski is a member. Based in Knoxville, Tennessee, the 51-year-old organization's website says it is "the world's leading membership, training and advocacy association for law enforcement chaplaincy."
In addition to being Carpentersville's police chaplain for about 20 years, Zilinski also works with East Dundee, West Dundee and Sleepy Hollow police and local fire departments should they need a chaplain and serves as pastor of Fox Valley Baptist Church in East Dundee.
Zilinski said this is his first trip to Israel and he will be accompanied by two dozen chaplains of other faiths, including fellow Protestant ministers, Catholic priests and Jewish rabbis.
The group will be based in Jerusalem but plans to travel the 60 miles or so to Gaza during their visit. There they intend to meet with local police officers and the families of officers who lost their lives during the current conflict. The initial attack in Israel on Oct. 7 resulted in the deaths of more than 1,200 people, and another 240 were taken hostage, according to Brittanica.com. Zilinksi said the chaplains group has been told at least 58 police officers lost their lives.
Israel declared war on Hamas, the controlling party in Palestine, which includes the Gaza Strip. In late January, CBS reported that the Hamas-led Health Ministry claimed more than 25,000 Palestinians have died during the current war.
"We as chaplains are here to minister to folks in the community going through hard times and the officers that deal with trauma," Zilinski said. "This was an opportunity to minister to officers and families going through a hard time and to offer our presence and support for them."
While he doesn't don't know exactly what he will say to the families, he will do a lot of listening and try to offer comfort, he said.
"Sometimes just being there for a person in a hard time is all they want or need," he said.
He has had opportunities to take part in trips of this kind before, he said, and never felt led to participate.
"This time something about it struck a chord in my heart and I knew I should go. I really can't explain it any better than just a gut feeling that I should do this," he said. "My goal is to be a help wherever I can and to provide blessing and encouragement to the law enforcement officers and their families in Israel."
Zilinski acknowledged there will be safety issues, but said the group won't take unnecessary risks and will be with Israeli police most of the time.
The cost of the trip is about $4,000, which Zilinski was able to raise with donations from his congregation, friends and family.
"I am thankful to all the people that I know who have been generous in helping make this trip possible," he said. "God has given me a great group of friends and family who support me in the vision that God has given me."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A sweeping emergency aid bill for Ukraine and Israel inched ahead in the Senate on Thursday, providing glimmers of hope for the measure after a series of setbacks.
But hurdles remained as Republicans slow-walked progress, demanding changes and feuding internally over whether to back it.
In a bipartisan show of support, the Senate voted 67-32 to advance the bill, with 17 Republicans joining Democrats to move it forward. The legislation would provide $60.1 billion for Ukraine, $14.1 billion for Israel and $10 billion in humanitarian aid for civilians in global conflicts. But many Republicans were still withholding their backing as they demanded changes to the package, and many others opposed it outright.
"We hope to reach an agreement with our Republican colleagues on amendments," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader. "We are going to keep working on this bill until the job is done."
Some predicted that Senate consideration could still take days, and leaders in both parties expected to spend the weekend working through the remaining disputes. If it survives and can pass, the legislation still faces steep challenges in the House, where a large group of Republicans is vehemently opposed. Still, proponents of the measure said Thursday's action suggested that the aid package, which has been stalled for months, might finally have a path toward approval in Congress.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the vote "a very important first step to continue support for Ukraine's victory and increase our shared security," in a social media post in which he wrote: "This is a bad day for Putin, and a good day for democracies."
Among other things, Senate Republicans are insisting on the opportunity to add border restrictions to the package -- despite having voted Wednesday to block a version of the legislation that included a bipartisan package of border restrictions. They spent much of Thursday haggling over which changes to seek.
The sluggish action was the latest manifestation of discord that has roiled the GOP and imperiled the emergency national security spending bill. Republicans have clashed over how to address international crises without angering the leader of their party and its likely presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.
Senate Republicans had initially signaled early Wednesday that they were likely to support moving a clean foreign aid bill without border provisions forward as long as they had opportunities to propose changes, terms that Schumer agreed to in principle. Leaders on both sides were optimistic that they would have enough backing to speedily advance the measure.
But their optimism soon gave way to frustration, as Republicans devolved into a familiar crouch, torn between rival factions and utterly unable to make a decision about how to proceed. They spent much of Wednesday afternoon and evening squabbling over which amendments to insist on -- and some argued privately they should not allow the bill to move forward at all.
Republican senators are split, with some staunchly supportive of sending a fresh infusion of military aid to help Ukraine fight off a Russian invasion, and those on the right deeply opposed to doing so. And some Republicans who back the aid are nonetheless concerned that doing so without exacting a price from Democrats would compromise them politically in an election year, given Trump's opposition to backing Ukraine's war effort.
"Failing to take this up is exactly what Putin hopes happens this week, and I'm going to do everything I can to prevent it," said one of them, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.
But other Republicans who have championed aid to Ukraine continued to withhold their support. They included Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma. Lankford spent the past four months negotiating a bipartisan deal to pair Ukraine funding with border security measures, a trade-off Republicans had demanded, only to have it rejected by Republicans on Wednesday.
Democrats also have a wish list of changes. Nearly 20 Democratic senators, most of them from the left wing of the party, have signed on to a proposal that would require recipients of security aid to use weapons in accordance with U.S. law, international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict -- and not hamper efforts to send humanitarian aid to civilians. While not specifically mentioning Israel, it was inspired by senators' concerns about that country's bombardment of the Gaza Strip running afoul of international law.

Full text: After three years of exceptional sales growth, McDonald's appears to be returning to Earth.
The Chicago burger giant said Monday it expects its same-store sales -- or sales at locations open at least a year -- to rise 3% to 4% this year, which is in line with historical averages. That's down from double-digit gains in 2021 and 2022 and 9% growth last year.
"I think we are moving into a 2024 that's going to look more like what you would have considered a typical year prior to COVID and all the things that have gone on," McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said Monday during a conference call with investors.
McDonald's shares dropped 3.5% in early trading.
McDonald's got a glimpse of what's to come in the fourth quarter when it lost sales in the Middle East and other markets due to the war in Gaza and saw fewer visits from lower-income consumers in the U.S.
McDonald's global same-store sales rose 3.4% in the October-December period, well below the 4.7% increase Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts polled by FactSet.
Customers in the Middle East were angered after McDonald's Israel – which is operated by a local franchisee -- announced in October it was providing free meals to Israeli soldiers. In response, some franchisees, like McDonald's Oman, announced donations to relief efforts in Gaza. Sales have since dropped in Muslim-majority countries like Malaysia and Indonesia as well as countries with large Muslim populations like France.
"So long as this conflict, this war, is going on... we're not expecting to see any significant improvement in this," Kempczinski said. "It's a human tragedy, what's going on, and I think that does weigh on brands like ours."
McDonald's wasn't the only U.S. company seeing backlash from the war in recent months. Starbucks said last week that it faced boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere because of its perceived support for Israel.
In the U.S., McDonald's same-store sales rose 4.3% in the October-December period, fueled by price increases as well as successful promotions like its Happy
Meal collaboration with artist Kerwin Frost. But Kempczinski said there were fewer visits and lower spending by customers earning $45,000 per year or less.
Kempczinski said that as grocery inflation has retreated, those customers are more likely to eat at home. McDonald's hopes to get those customers back into its stores this year with marketing that emphasizes low-cost options.
"We certainly know consumers are more wary -- and weary -- of pricing and we're going to continue to be consumer-led in our pricing decisions as we look forward to 2024," Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden said.
In China, where consumer sentiment is at record lows, McDonald's is also ramping up deals to match competitors, Borden said.
It was an unexpected end to an otherwise strong year for the burger giant. Viral marketing hits, like last spring's Grimace shakes, and upgraded menu items helped to boost full-year revenue by 10% to nearly $25 billion.
McDonald's revenue rose 8% to $6.4 billion in the fourth quarter, meeting analyst expectations. Net income was up 7% to $2 billion.
Excluding one-time items, such as $66 million restructuring charge, the company earned $2.95 per share. That beat analysts' forecast of a $2.83 per-share profit.

Full text: At about a dozen high schools across the city Tuesday, Chicago Public Schools students held walkouts to demand aldermen vote in favor of a cease-fire resolution scheduled for the City Council on Wednesday. After a contentious delay last week, the vote is expected to be heated.
Co-sponsored by Ald. Rossana Rodriguez, 33rd, and Ald. Daniel La Spata, 1st, the resolution, demands President Joe Biden and the U.S. Congress "call for and facilitate a permanent cease-fire to end the ongoing violence in Gaza; call for humanitarian assistance including medicine, food and water, to be sent into the impacted region; and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages."
About 300 students spilled out of Lane Tech High School at noon, gathering for speeches before marching across a grassy expanse in front of Chicago's largest high school.
Sophomore Niani Darden said she was moved by the turnout -- the largest mobilization of students at the school that she's seen.
"Obviously there's a problem and we're actually acknowledging it," she said of the students' demand that aldermen support the cease-fire resolution in City Council Wednesday.
"I think the thing that's really important is that a lot of us think that we don't really make a difference, because we're in Chicago and we're very far from the Gaza Strip. But we definitely can."
Several dozen students gathered outside Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, holding red-and-green cardboard signs.
They marched, circling the campus as they chanted "Free Palestine." Other students peered through the windows of their classrooms as the group passed by.
Eisha Aly, speaking through a megaphone, offered statistics about the conflict. "We've seen bloody, wounded children," the 18-year-old said. "Palestinians live in constant fear of being killed."
At Jones College Prep in the South Loop, students fixed keffiyehs on one another in the lobby as they prepared to head out the doors for a walkout around 2 p.m.
Alexander Huynh, a senior at Jones College Prep, said she was happy to walk out of her study hall period early. "I'm out here because what's happening is wrong," said Huynh, who turns 18 next week. "There's a genocide going on and we need to stop it. There needs to be awareness about this."
"Us students, young people -- we pay attention," Huynh said.
More than 20 students from Curie High School marched to Jones College Prep, chanting "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" as they joined forces before heading together to City Hall in hundreds.
Ald. Ruth Cruz, 33rd, who represents Chicago Academy High School, supports the resolution calling for a cease-fire.
Ald. Debra Silverstein, 50th, the council's lone Jewish member, has pushed for changes big and small in support of Israel, including lobbying for the removal of support for a U.N. cease-fire resolution opposed by the federal government.
At a City Hall news conference Tuesday, Silverstein shared support for an opposing resolution sponsored by Ald. Raymond Lopez, 15th, calling only for the release of hostages held by Hamas.
Outside City Hall, hundreds of high schoolers participating in the walkout marched down LaSalle Street. Roughly 250 protesters entered the building and held an hourlong sit-in on its lower level.
Lukas Sheves, an 18-year-old senior at Jones College Prep, said the student-led demonstration speaks to the power young people possess in holding adults in office accountable. "It tells them that they need to start paying more attention," Sheves said outside City Hall.
"I think people forget that Chicago is made up of so many different groups and we have the largest diaspora outside of Palestine of Palestinians in America. We can't just not acknowledge what Palestinians have been experiencing for over 75 years. And that is why we need to have protests like this. That is why we need to stand up like this."
More than 26,000 people have died since Israeli airstrikes intensified in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, according to Gaza health authorities and Associated Press reporting. Children are bearing "ghastly wounds of war," James Elder, a spokesperson for UNICEF, a United Nations program that provides humanitarian aid to children worldwide, told journalists in December.
According to a December UNICEF briefing, at least 1,000 children in Gaza have lost one or both of their legs and "deaths of youngsters from disease will likely surpass those from bombardment in the absence of a ceasefire." Without food, water, shelter and sanitation in Gaza, a rampant combination of "soaring malnutrition" and diarrhea may prove deadly, UNICEF said. "Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children," U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in November.
Ahead of the walkout, CPS sent families an email that the district was working with principals at schools where walkouts were planned to ensure "students can express their First Amendment rights safely" and to provide materials to guide classroom discussions about the war."
At a Monday news conference, the Chicago Teachers Union joined other labor unions in calling for a cease-fire.
But the union advised teachers that "Chicago Board of Education employees must remain in their assigned divisions or classes during any student-taken civic action unless school leadership determines that staff member supervision might be necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of students," according to an email sent to union members and obtained by the Tribune.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- U.S.-led negotiators are edging closer to an agreement in which Israel would suspend its war in the Gaza Strip for about two months in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas, a deal that could be sealed in the next two weeks and would transform the conflict consuming the region.
Negotiators have developed a draft agreement merging proposals offered by Israel and Hamas in the last 10 days into a basic framework that will be the subject of talks Sunday in Paris. While there are disagreements to be worked out, negotiators are cautiously optimistic that a final accord is within reach, according to U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity.
President Joe Biden spoke by phone separately Friday with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, who have served as intermediaries with Hamas, to narrow the remaining differences. He is also sending his CIA director, William Burns, to Paris for Sunday's talks with Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials.
In a statement in Israel on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to securing the release of those hostages who were not freed as part of a more limited agreement in November.
The short-lived truce in November resulted in a seven-​day pause in the fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages by Hamas and about 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. About 136 people seized Oct. 7 remain unaccounted for, including six U.S. citizens, although about two dozen of those are presumed to be dead.
The deal now coming together would be more expansive in scope than the previous one, officials say.
In the first phase, fighting would stop for about 30 days while women, elderly and wounded hostages were released by Hamas. During that period, the two sides would work out details of a second phase that would suspend military operations for roughly another 30 days in exchange for Israeli soldiers and male civilians being held.
Officials close to the talks believe that if Israel halts the war for two months, it would likely not resume it in the same way that it has waged it until now. The truce would provide a window for further diplomacy that could lead to a broader resolution of the conflict.
Meanwhile, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main organization aiding Gaza's population amid the humanitarian disaster, said nine countries suspended their funding following Israel's allegations that a number of Gaza staff members participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that sparked the war. Those joining the United States included Australia, Britain, Canada, Finland and Italy.
Agency chief Philippe Lazzarini said it would be "irresponsible" to sanction it and the community it serves at such a desperate time for Gazans, especially after it quickly fired the "small group" of staffers. The 13,000-strong agency, which relies almost entirely on countries' contributions, said it now runs shelters for more than 1 million people and its lifeline "can collapse anytime now."
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, destroyed vast swaths of Gaza and displaced nearly 85% of the territory's 2.3 million people. The Hamas attack in southern Israel killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and roughly 250 hostages were taken.
At least 174 Palestinians were killed over the past day, the Health Ministry in Gaza said. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its tolls, but has said about two-thirds are women and children.
Israel holds Hamas responsible for civilian casualties, saying fighters embed themselves in the local population. Israel says its air and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 9,000 fighters.
Israel's military said it had conducted several "targeted raids on terror targets" in the southern city of Khan Younis in addition to an airstrike in nearby Rafah targeting a Hamas commander.
More than 1 million people have crammed into Rafah and the surrounding areas after Israel ordered civilians to seek refuge there. Designated evacuation areas have repeatedly come under airstrikes, with Israel saying it would go after militants as needed.
In Muwasi, a narrow coastal strip once designated as a safe zone but struck in recent days, displaced Palestinians tiptoed through garbage-lined puddles in chilly weather. Walls of sheets and tarps billowed in the wind. A mother wept after rain leaked in and soaked the blankets.
"This is our life," said Bassam Bolbol, whose family ended up in Muwasi after leaving Khan Younis and finding no shelter in Rafah.
The World Health Organization and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders issued urgent warnings about the largest health facility in Khan Younis, Nasser Hospital, saying remaining staff could barely function with supplies running out and intense fighting nearby.
WHO footage showed people in the facility being treated on blood-smeared floors as frantic loved ones shouted and jostled. Cats scavenged on a mound of medical waste.

Full text: Cold, almost naked and surrounded by Israeli soldiers with M16 rifles, Ayman Lubbad knelt among dozens of Palestinian men and boys who had just been forced from their homes in the northern Gaza Strip.
It was early December and photographs and videos taken at the time showed him and other detainees in the street, wearing only underwear and lined up in rows, surrounded by Israeli forces.
In one video, a soldier yelled at them over a megaphone: "We're occupying all of Gaza. Is that what you wanted? You want Hamas with you? Don't tell me you're not Hamas."
The detainees, some barefoot with their hands on their heads, shouted objections.
"I'm a day laborer," one man shouted.
"Shut up," the soldier yelled back.
Palestinian detainees from Gaza have been stripped, beaten, interrogated and held incommunicado over the past three months, according to accounts by nearly a dozen of the detainees or their relatives interviewed by The New York Times. Organizations representing Palestinian prisoners and detainees gave similar accounts in a report, accusing Israel of both indiscriminate detention of civilians and demeaning treatment of detainees.
Israeli forces who invaded Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack have detained men, women and children by the thousands.
Some were ordered out of their houses and seized while others were taken as they fled their neighborhoods on foot with their families, trying to reach safer areas after Israeli authorities ordered them to leave.
Photographs taken by Gaza journalists have shown newly released detainees being treated in hospitals, the skin around their wrists worn down with deep cuts from the tight restraints Israeli forces kept on them, sometimes for weeks at a time.
The U.N. human rights office said last week that Israel's treatment of detainees from Gaza might amount to torture. It estimated that thousands had been detained and held in "horrific" conditions before being released, sometimes with no clothes on, only diapers.
The Israeli military said in a statement that it detains people suspected of involvement in terrorist activity and releases those who are cleared. It said authorities were treating detainees in accordance with international law and defended forcing men and boys to strip, saying this was to "ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry."
"Detainees are given back their clothes when it's possible," the military added.
Human rights defenders say Israel's detention and demeaning treatment of Palestinians in Gaza could violate international laws of war.
"Since the beginning of the Israeli bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza, the Israeli army arrested hundreds of Palestinians in a barbaric and unprecedented manner and has published pictures and videos showing the inhumane treatment of detainees," said a recent report by several Palestinian rights groups, including the Palestinian Prisoners' Commission and Addameer.
"So far, Israel has concealed the fate of detainees from Gaza, has not disclosed their numbers, and prevented lawyers and the Red Cross from visiting detainees," the report added.
A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, Hisham Mhanna, said his organization received daily reports from families in Gaza about detained family members. The organization is working on some 4,000 cases of Palestinians from Gaza who had vanished, nearly half believed to be detained by the Israeli military, he said.
The group has been seeking information about the conditions and whereabouts of detainees and pushing for visits. But only in a handful of cases has it even received proof of life, Mhanna said.
Brian Finucane, an analyst at the research organization International Crisis Group and a former legal adviser to the State Department, said international law sets "a very high bar" to detain noncombatants and requires that they be treated humanely.
During the first month of the war, Israel warned those who did not flee areas under evacuation orders that they "may be considered a partner in a terrorist organization." Last month an Israeli government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, said Israeli forces were detaining "military-age men" in those areas.
"The presumption that military-aged males are combatants is troubling," Finucane said.
Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, said in October that designating civilians who did not evacuate as accomplices to terrorism was not only a threat of collective punishment, but could constitute ethnic cleansing.
Photos and videos taken by Israeli soldiers and Israeli journalists embedded with the military have shown Palestinians with hands bound behind their backs, sometimes blindfolded and in underwear, kneeling outdoors in winter.
In one video taken at a stadium in Gaza City, dozens of males wearing only underwear are lined up or marched across the field surrounded by Israeli soldiers. Some of the men were gray-haired and several were young boys.
Women and girls were also present, but they remained clothed.
One detainee was Hadeel al-Dahdouh, 22, who appeared in another photo published last month in the back of truck packed with almost naked men. In the image, her eyes were covered by a blindfold and her headscarf had been removed.
She and her husband, Rushdi al-Thatha, both from Gaza City in the north, were taken together Dec. 5, al-Thatha said.
"They would hit us on our heads with their weapons," said al-Thatha, one of a number of detainees who described being beaten by Israeli soldiers. "They would hit my wife like they hit me," he said. "They would yell 'Shut up!' and curse at her."
Al-Thatha, 31, said he was released after 25 days. Al-Dahdouh is still missing.
On the day when Lubbad was detained, Dec. 7, he was at his parents' house with his wife, he said. She had given birth weeks earlier to their third child. They could hear gunfire and tanks in the streets and then an Israeli soldier yelled on a megaphone for all men to come out and surrender.
As soon as he walked out, arms up, he said, he was confronted by a soldier who ordered him to kneel and strip. In the December chill, he was kept on his knees in the back row of a line of Palestinian men and some boys -- all in their underwear, some barefoot.
Lubbad, a human rights worker with the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, said his detention lasted a week. In the first moments, he said, he told himself he would do whatever the soldiers ordered.
"We didn't know what awaits us," he said.

Full text: The U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into accusations of antisemitism at Northwestern University, as similar allegations continue to rock colleges and universities across the country in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.
A complaint against Northwestern was filed earlier this month by Zachary Marschall of Campus Reform, a Virginia-based organization that describes itself as a “conservative watchdog” that “exposes liberal bias and abuse on the nation’s college campuses.”
The education department’s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation into Northwestern on Tuesday, according to the agency’s website. The complaint alleges that Northwestern “discriminated against students on the basis of national origin (shared Jewish ancestry) by failing to respond appropriately to incidents of harassment in October, November and December,” according to a letter from the agency posted on Campus Reform’s website.
Campus Reform’s website says the complaint cited an Instagram post from a student organization that called Hamas a “political group;” other incidents include a student vigil in which the colors of the Palestinian flag were projected on a library building and a protest urging Northwestern to divest from organizations that support Israel, where demonstrators chanted “Northwestern, you can’t hide — you’re paying for genocide,” according to the Campus Reform website.
The website also quotes the complaint as saying that Jewish students “have felt increasingly unwelcome” since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, which killed roughly 1,200 and plunged the Middle East into a bloody ongoing war.
Northwestern officials confirmed the education department’s investigation, adding that the university intends to cooperate.
“The complaint against Northwestern was not filed by a member of our community but instead by an outside organization,” said Northwestern spokesman Jon Yates. “The Department of Education is investigating dozens of universities. Northwestern is committed to providing a safe, welcoming environment for everyone in our community.”
He added that Northwestern “does not tolerate antisemitism or discriminatory acts directed at any individual based upon their race, religion, national origin or other protected categories.”
Marschall and Campus Reform did not immediately return requests for comment. Campus Reform has filed other complaints alleging antisemitism at various other colleges and universities nationwide, including Arizona State University and Temple University. The complaints allege the universities violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination by any institution that receives federal funding.
Education department officials would not comment on the Northwestern investigation because it’s a pending complaint. In order for the Office of Civil Rights to proceed on a complaint, there must be “sufficient information to support the factual basis for the complainant’s belief that discrimination has occurred and when it occurred,” according to the office’s case resolution and investigation manual.
Northwestern President Michael Schill in November announced a new advisory committee would work to prevent antisemitism and hate on campus, adding that he’s “heard from students and parents who feel unsafe” since the Israel-Hamas war’s inception, according to a university statement.
On Tuesday, Schill announced the names of the members of the committee, which pledged in a letter to “help create the conditions for members of our community to thrive without fear of hate or violence (both physical and psychological).”
Michael Simon, executive director at Northwestern Hillel and a member of the committee, said he was aware of the investigation at Northwestern.
“There’s certainly been a rising concern among students and the broader Jewish community at Northwestern about antisemitism, both in terms of the climate on campus here as well as many other campuses and communities,” he said.
Simon said at the “baseline level,” Northwestern has a “thriving, welcomed and welcoming” Jewish community.
“But it feels that because of challenges in the climate, we are not at that baseline at this moment,” he said. “We at Hillel ... we’re committed to make sure we get back to not only that baseline but a better place.”
Simon added that he wants every student — not just Jewish students — to feel welcome at Northwestern.
Roughly 1,200 Jewish undergraduates and 1,000 Jewish graduate students attend Northwestern, according to Hillel International.
The investigation at Northwestern comes as colleges and universities across the country grapple with accusations of antisemitism, a climate that has spurred several prominent higher education leaders to recently resign under fire.
Harvard President Claudine Gay quit earlier this month amid fallout from her testimony during a heated congressional hearing on antisemitism at college campuses in December, as well as recent plagiarism accusations. A hedge fund billionaire who led calls for Gay’s removal has also urged the resignation of Penny Pritzker, head of Harvard’s governing board and sister of Gov. J.B. Pritzker, though Harvard has said she has no plans to step down.
The University of Pennsylvania’s president also quit last month after being grilled at the congressional hearing, and the chairman of the school’s board of trustees stepped down as well.
Earlier this month, a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago filed a lawsuit alleging that she faced a pattern of harassment and antisemitic discrimination there.
Shortly after the Hamas attack, an SAIC associate professor posted an antisemitic rant on social media, calling Israelis “pigs” and “savages,” and calling for them to “rot in hell.” The SAIC student’s complaint said she asked several SAIC leaders if she was safe attending school there, citing those social media posts, but the school never responded, according to one of the accusations in the lawsuit.
An SAIC official said the school could not comment on pending litigation; the official did say that associate professor is no longer employed at the school but would not give any more information, citing “personnel matters.” The SAIC associate professor had apologized for the post on social media.

The Biden administration in November addressed an “alarming” rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and colleges since the war began.
Antisemitism has surged nationwide recently, with the Anti-Defamation League counting about 300 antisemitic incidents in roughly two weeks following the Hamas attack, a 388% increase over the same period in 2022. An ADL report in November found that nearly three-quarters of Jewish college students reported seeing or experiencing some form of antisemitism since the start of the school year.
During the December congressional hearing, a professor of Jewish studies acknowledged that “voicing antisemitism is not illegal.”
“We cannot censor antisemitic speech, nor can we command everyone in our university community to support human rights,” said Pamela Nadell, director of the Jewish Studies Program at American University. “What we must do is make certain that everyone on the campus — students, faculty and staff, no matter their religious, racial, ethnic or national background — feels safe and does not encounter discrimination in any form, whether in the classroom from faculty members who single out Jewish students or from student organizations that use litmus tests requiring Jewish students to distance themselves from Israel if they wish to be members.”

Full text: JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a defiant tone over the weekend in marking Monday's 100 days of war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, vowing to keep fighting despite growing uncertainty over the outcome, international alarm over the mounting loss of life in the enclave and fears of a broader regional conflagration.
His pledge to continue until "total victory" came even as Israel awaited a decision from the world's top court on a possible injunction against its military's devastating offensive in Gaza.
Launched in retaliation for the deadly Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault, the Israeli military's war against Hamas has killed nearly 24,000 Palestinians, a majority of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, and displaced most of the enclave's population of 2.3 million.
Warning of a long conflict, the remarks from Netanyahu and comments from the Israeli military over the weekend exposed a growing dissonance between the domestic perception of the timing and goals of the war and increasing international impatience in the face of a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
The United States, Israel's most important ally, has urged Israel to deescalate. The White House said Sunday that the 100-day mark is "the right time" for Israel to scale down its military offensive in the Gaza Strip. Many other countries have called for an immediate cease-fire.
"We are continuing the war until the end -- until total victory, until we achieve all of our goals," Netanyahu declared in a televised news conference Saturday night, saying that "eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel" are the goals.
"Nobody will stop us -- not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else," he added.
The Hague is where the United Nations' top court is hearing accusations brought by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
The court's judges heard two days of hearings last week and will now decide whether to call on Israel to adopt provisional measures, such as a stop to fighting, while it assesses the merit of the genocide claim. No date has been set for the announcement of that decision, and, in any case, the court has few means of enforcing its rulings.
Netanyahu in the same breath invoked Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, whose military actions in solidarity, they say, with Palestinians in Gaza have raised the specter of a wider conflict.
The United States led airstrikes Thursday and Friday against sites in Yemen controlled by the Houthi militia, in response to more than two dozen Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea since November.
But the Houthis retained much of their ability to fire missiles and drones, according to U.S. officials.
At the same time, clashes across the Israel-Lebanon border continued over the weekend.
An antitank missile launched Sunday from Lebanon hit a house in northern Israel, killing a farmer and his mother, according to initial reports. Israel's military said its fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and its forces had engaged in a firefight overnight with assailants who crossed into Israeli-controlled territory from Lebanon. Three attackers were killed and five soldiers were wounded, the military said.
Tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from the country's northern border areas, and Israel has warned that it will resort to military action if diplomatic efforts to allow their safe return home do not bear fruit. Thousands of Lebanese civilians have also fled the border area.
On Sunday, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, struck a tone of defiance.
"After 99 days," he said, "we are ready for war. We are not afraid of it."
While Netanyahu acknowledged Sunday that the war "will yet take many months," his remarks the previous night appeared to be as focused on raising domestic morale as on countering international criticism of the military campaign.
Addressing doubters who have cast the Israeli government's goal of destroying Hamas, the militant group that has controlled Gaza for 16 years, as unrealistic, he said: "It is possible, it is necessary, and we will do it."
As the death toll in Gaza has climbed, international calls for a cease-fire have mounted. The United Nations has warned that half the population is at risk of starvation.

Full text: The acts of terrorism committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians and the unprecedented loss of civilian life from Israel's counterinsurgency operation in Gaza over the past 2 1/2 months are heartbreaking. I weep for every civilian killed and every family torn apart.
The U.S. has a responsibility to do everything in its power to prevent future suffering and allow aid to flow into Gaza to address the humanitarian crisis. But the tools we have to use must acknowledge three realities:
1. The rise of extreme voices in Israel and Palestine substantially increased political volatility in the years leading up to the Oct. 7 attacks.
2. Every country -- including, but not limited, to Israel -- has an absolute right to defend itself and its citizens from external attacks.
3. The only path to a permanent, durable cease-fire is the creation of two fully independent and peaceful states between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.
I am not a foreign policy expert but have traveled extensively in the region and met with political leaders and civil society in Israel and the West Bank. I also have the privilege to represent one of the largest Palestinian American communities in the country.
In the aftermath of Oct. 7, much of the domestic debate has focused on the need for a cease-fire. Which we all want -- but a meaningful cease-fire has to be durable and bilateral and come with accountability. Neither a unilateral cease-fire nor a return to the brittle conditions of Oct. 6 is sufficient.
So how do we get there? I believe that goal is paced by four distinct issues.
First, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In all likelihood, the prime minister's political career is over when the war ends. He is also facing corruption charges that may carry even greater penalties. Americans are all too familiar with the risks posed to a democracy when such figures see their political lives coming to an end. A lasting peace requires first that Netanyahu does not prolong the war to preserve his own political career and, second, that a post-Netanyahu Israel does not double down on the authoritarian, far-right politics he has espoused.
Second, Hamas.
Let us assume success in the first goal. That means an Israel that reverses the expansion of settlements, treats the Palestinian Authority as a partner for peace and ideally puts us back on a path to something like the Oslo Accords. How do we ensure that Hamas is still held accountable for its actions on Oct. 7 and is fully demilitarized and that its methods are not seen as the necessary agent of that peace? How do we ensure that Palestinian civil society doesn't perceive that peace as being the direct result of Hamas' violence on Oct. 7?
Third, Iran.
The current war between Israel and Hamas is only the latest battle in a decadeslong proxy war as Iran seeks to expand its regional influence. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost in Yemen and Syria alone. Iran's hostility to Israel is well known in the U.S.; its hostility to all who don't share its desire for a Shia caliphate is a reality for too many in the region. Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than it was before Donald Trump's maximum pressure campaign, and its malign influence has only increased. Regional peace depends on fundamentally changing the Iranian government's mode of engagement with its neighbors.
And finally, the Abraham Accords.
The last few years have brought normalization and commercial relationships between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Sudan. In the weeks before Oct. 7, Israel was rumored to be closing in on a similar arrangement with Saudi Arabia. That is a necessary and positive step toward a regional peace. However, the Trump administration developed these arrangements in tandem with a proposed map for a future Palestinian state that was riddled with settlement expansion in the West Bank. The threat of isolation from the broader Arab world has arguably contributed to a closer alliance between certain Palestinian groups and Iran -- to the detriment of regional peace. How shall we expand the peace of the Abraham Accords without placing that progress in opposition to Iranian and Palestinian interests?
The U.S. can, and will, continue to engage and -- where necessary -- use diplomatic pressure on Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other states in the region to help make these futures possible. To stop settlement expansion in the West Bank and take actions against settler violence. To make it clear that Israel's war is against Hamas, not the Palestinian people, and minimize civilian casualties as it maximizes humanitarian assistance. To work with regional partners to rebuild Gaza and provide trusted security and equal rights to the Palestinian people. To identify, elevate and, when appropriate, empower moderate voices on both sides of the green line who will be partners in this effort. To continue to advance normalization of relations between Israel and all of their neighbors -- including a fully autonomous Palestinian state.
This will not be easy. And it is impossible as long as either side is led by those who call for a single state from the river to the sea. But it is necessary and desperately overdue.

Full text: When our family lived in Jerusalem in the mid-1990s — where I was working as the Tribune’s Middle East correspondent — we were awed by the hope among both Israelis and Palestinians that the 1993 Oslo Accords might end their age-old conflict. The agreement signed on the White House lawn that year gave real hope for peace in modern times.
Then an extremist Jewish settler slaughtered 29 Palestinian men and boys as they knelt in prayer in a Hebron mosque in 1994. Hamas suicide bombers blew up buses to butcher Israelis on Jerusalem’s streets. A Jewish extremist shot and killed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv in 1995. People on both sides overwhelmingly supported the Oslo process, but hateful extremists in each camp refused to share the Holy Land. So, they started killing Oslo. Thirty years later, its promise remains on life support.
Today, new extremists on both sides are determined to drive nails into any possible peaceful resolution to the conflict and the dream of a two-state solution. President Joe Biden must not let that happen. Too much is at stake. The impact of the brutal war raging in the destitute Gaza Strip echoes way beyond the Middle East and could radicalize a new generation of terrorists.
Since the bloody, barbaric attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 massacred 1,200 Israeli men, women, children and elderly near Gaza and touched off the war, there has been no concrete plan advanced by the combatants for the day after the fighting between Israel and Hamas stops — whether it’s weeks from now, or perhaps, months away.
Biden needs to start working forcefully now to outline that vision and build support for it among Israelis and Palestinians, as well as allies in the region and around the globe. Both sides must see a horizon with hope, security and justice, or they will face endless violence, war and death. There is no military solution to this conflict. Only a two-state endgame offers a viable, long-term political solution that could one day work — even if, after all this trauma, it takes years to happen.
The president should lay out the strategy in a prime-time Oval Office address and call on moderate Arab states, the European Union and the U.N. for support. Arab states will not be eager to help fund the reconstruction of Gaza without a serious commitment to a two-state pathway.
It likely will require leadership changes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a longtime opponent of two states. That’s a problem. His failure to focus sufficiently on Israel’s security may have left Israel vulnerable to attack near Gaza, and his days as prime minister could be numbered. A formal commission of inquiry should await him at the end of the war. Israelis are demanding accountability. His popularity has fallen in polls, and 80% of Israelis believe he should accept responsibility for the staggering failures in security that led to the Oct. 7 attacks.
“The only way we believe there can be a successful vision for the day after is with a different Israeli government,” said Adina Vogel-Ayalon, chief of staff of J Street in Washington, D.C., a pro-Israel, pro-peace organization advocating for U.S. policies that promote Jewish and democratic values for Israel.
“That is one of the many obstacles at this moment in time,” she told me. “This Israeli government is resisting every plan for the day after that this administration has been promoting.” J Street advocates for post-conflict arrangements that establish a path to an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel in the future, and steps to get there successfully.
In the middle of this horrifying war, this may seem like a pipe dream, but the sheer scale of this violence could ultimately shock the two parties into the realization that war is not the answer. The Yom Kippur War led, years later, to Camp David and an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
For the Palestinian Authority, increasingly ineffective and unpopular under President Mahmoud Abbas, elections must be held in the West Bank and Gaza after the war to revitalize the self-rule government, so eventually it can take over governing Gaza from a transitional authority of some kind when Israel pulls out. Netanyahu has said Israeli forces will stay there indefinitely, but Biden has rightly warned Israel not to reoccupy Gaza. That would be a mistake that could further radicalize Gazans and prolong conflict. Unlike Hamas, the Palestinian Authority is committed to a negotiated solution, and Biden envoys are right to seek a security role for it in Gaza.
By pledging America’s ironclad support to Israel during the last 70 days of war in Gaza, the United States now owns this conflict too. The Biden administration must use its leverage with Israel to help end it, as soon as possible, once Israel decimates Hamas, and to help ensure a transition first to a multinational force, and ultimately, to the Palestinian Authority.
[ Elizabeth Shackelford: The US should use its leverage with Israel to help minimize civilian harm in the war ]
Israel has every right to defend itself. Hamas is a terrorist organization that has no interest in peace. Make no mistake, its goal is to kill Jews and destroy Israel. Its Oct. 7 attack was the deadliest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas has pledged to do it again. It puts Gazan civilians in the crossfire and hides under hospitals. Israel cannot and should not have to live with that threat on its border. America wouldn’t.
Hamas took 240 hostages on Oct. 7, and an estimated 135 of them — including 10 Americans — remain captive in the dark tunnels under Gaza. The atrocities, rapes and murders of Israelis were unspeakable. Some of the dead were so badly burned or mutilated that they are only now being identified through DNA. The trauma is ongoing, and so are the funerals.
“Everyone walks around pretending to be normal,” one Israeli friend told me, “but the whole country is suffering from trauma. It will be years until Israel begins to resemble its old self.”
Israel’s retaliation has been fierce. The Israeli military campaign has leveled much of Gaza’s infrastructure and claimed the lives of at least 18,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gazan health officials. Some 80% of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced. Israel estimates thousands of Hamas fighters have died. Still, the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding there is raising alarm around the world. Biden’s unwavering support remains strong, but his administration is calling on Israel for a more targeted strategy.
“I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives. Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful,” Biden said last week, warning that Israel could lose international support because of the “indiscriminate bombing that takes place.”
One Palestinian friend lost 14 members of his extended family in the bombing. “It’s so painful,” he wrote to me, “when one, every two or three hours, searches the lists of the death toll with fear of finding names of his relatives or friends.”
The fear is that the longer this goes on, the more radical the Palestinian population will become, so that any plan for peace, stabilization and reconstruction the day after the war will be harder to achieve.
“I don’t think there is a day after. I don’t think this is going to stop,” observed Rashid Khalidi, co-editor of the Journal of Palestine Studies and professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University. “I don’t think the Israelis will bring resistance to an end. I don’t think there is a stable Gaza coming.
“The fighters they kill will have little brothers and others who will go on fighting for years,” Khalidi told me. “What they have done is produced a situation that is not going to have a clear end.”
That is the challenge, but Biden has to forge bold diplomacy and lay out the road map for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians. There have been five wars over the past 15 years, and this is by far the deadliest. Clearly, Israel’s strategy of blockading and containing Gazans in an open-air prison, as some call it, is not succeeding. Netanyahu’s strategy has left Israelis more at risk.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has also warned Israeli leaders they might win a tactical victory against Hamas but risk “strategic defeat” in the long run if they fail to heed warnings about the impact of the rising civilian death toll.

The U.S. must support Israel’s effort to degrade Hamas so that it is no longer a threat, but it should continue to urge a more careful military strategy within the bounds of international law to protect Palestinian civilians who had nothing do with the Hamas attack. The pressure campaign may eventually lead to another pause in the fighting to allow Hamas to give up more hostages, but Hamas leaders are not likely to leave Gaza. They know Israelis will hunt them down when they come out of their tunnels, as well it should. They must be driven out.
When the war ends, the U.S. must lead an international campaign to restore all humanitarian aid and rebuild Gaza, along with the Israeli communities attacked by Hamas. Israelis must have security guarantees they will be safe in the aftermath, and Palestinians must be offered hope for justice and self-determination in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
When distributing U.S. military aid, Biden should join a group of Democratic senators insisting it should come with zero tolerance for settler violence, settlement expansion, blockades and the expulsion of Arabs from their homes or villages. Some extremist, anti-Arab members in Netanyahu’s coalition continue to provoke violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
Both sides deserve peace, economic opportunity and a safe place to raise their children. They pledged at Oslo to work together toward those goals. That work remains unfinished.
It may seem naive — even a fool’s errand — to talk about peace plans at a time like this. The wounds on both sides are so deep, it may take years to get the parties back to the table, let alone trust that there is a true partner for peace on the other side. But that is the only way this ends without more violence, with a two-state outcome and two peoples living side by side in peace.

Full text: The White House continues to send mixed signals on America's support for Israel. That emboldens Hamas and needs to stop.
At a fundraiser last Tuesday, President Joe Biden vigorously defended the Jewish state, saying that the United States is "not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process. Not a single thing." ...
Yet at that same fundraiser, Biden publicly warned Israeli leaders that they risked losing international support for their response to the Oct. 7 terror attack if they continue "indiscriminate bombing." And by the end of the week, the administration's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, was pressuring Israel to wrap up its military campaign and accept a Gaza run by the Palestinian Authority. This is unhelpful. Hamas has made clear that its goal is to eliminate the state of Israel. It has carried out unspeakable attacks on civilians and continues to hold hostages -- including eight American citizens -- that it took during its barbaric Oct. 7 incursion. The terror group intentionally hides military targets among civilians, revealing a callous disregard for the lives of its own people. ...
The conflicting rhetoric makes it only more difficult for Israel to achieve its goals. On Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby allowed that, "The last thing we would want to do is telegraph to Hamas what they're likely to face in coming weeks and months."
Really? What other practical effect does the administration's public stance that Israel wind everything down and avoid "indiscriminate" attacks have than to telegraph to Hamas that it will live to terrorize the Jewish state another day if it can postpone defeat for a few months? ...
The task becomes even more difficult when Biden and his advisers repeatedly imply that American support for Israel is wavering. It must not.

Full text: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is traveling to the Middle East this week in part to press Israel to moderate its war plans in Gaza and prepare for a transition to lower-intensity operations against top Hamas commanders. President Joe Biden’s administration is increasingly impatient about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a small coastal territory that has essentially become hell on earth.
The Israelis, meanwhile, are increasingly impatient about the situation in the north, near Israel’s border with Lebanon. Ever since the war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, the Israeli military and Hezbollah, the Lebanese terrorist group that runs south Lebanon, have been firing at each other across the United Nations-demarcated border. Hezbollah drones and missiles, some of which are precision-guided, frequently target empty Israeli settlements and military posts. The Israelis quickly retaliate with airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons facilities, launch sites and Hezbollah cells preparing attacks. Approximately 94 Hezbollah fighters, as well as eight Israeli soldiers, have been killed in the bombardments, along with dozens of civilians. Tens of thousands of Israelis have evacuated the northern towns and kibbutzim near the Israel-Lebanon border.
Fortunately, the exchanges have been contained to the border region. But it doesn’t take a geopolitical expert to understand that one errant rocket or airstrike with a high casualty rate could turn controlled escalation into chaos. Indeed, just as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is receiving pressure from some quarters to negotiate another truce with Hamas, Netanyahu is getting flak from Israelis in the north who want to return to their homes. Earlier in the war, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made the case that Hezbollah should be attacked preemptively to degrade the militia group’s ability to conduct an Oct. 7-style attack in the north. That recommendation was ultimately rejected.
Yet as hostilities on the Israel-Lebanon border persist, Netanyahu may eventually have a change of heart. Gallant remains committed to his position, warning the United States, Lebanon, Iran and every state in between that “if the world doesn’t get Hezbollah away from the border, Israel will do it.”
An Israeli military spokesman was more ominous: “Hezbollah — a proxy of Iran — is dragging Lebanon into an unnecessary war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Lebanon.” The statement amounts to a soft ultimatum to the world.
From Washington’s standpoint, the ultimatum evokes mixed feelings. On the one hand, Hezbollah is the region’s most formidable terrorist group, equipped with state-of-the-art missiles that can rain down fury on every major city in Israel. Yet on the other, a large-scale Israeli campaign against Hezbollah, even if it were warranted, is the last thing the U.S. wants right now. The Biden administration has invested significant diplomatic capital into containing the fighting to Gaza and preventing it from spreading to other faultlines in the Middle East. Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA Director William Burns, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown Jr. and President Joe Biden himself have all flown to the region in the hope of tamping down the flames of war. While all of these officials recognize that Israel has a responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism, none of them wants to see Israel take rash actions that could cause more problems and suck the U.S. into a war it would (rightly) rather avoid.
We should be under no illusions: If Israel were to act preemptively against Hezbollah, and the Lebanese militia group were to retaliate by launching some of the more than 150,000 missiles in its arsenal, it’s highly likely the U.S. would get more directly involved on Israel’s behalf. The U.S. military posture in the Middle East is already in a high state of alert and larger than it has been in years. Two aircraft carriers remain stationed in the region’s waters, both carrying numerous fighter and bomber aircraft onboard. There are too many U.S. warships in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean to count, but all of them are equipped with the kinds of cruise missiles that would allow Washington to target Hezbollah positions at a relatively safe distance. The Biden administration has reportedly discussed possible military options against Hezbollah.

To date, all of those discussions are preliminary. This is what U.S. officials in the national security space do: They consider various contingencies and plan in the hopes that the worse-case scenario never occurs.
Averting the worse-case scenario, however, takes a lot of work, patience, persistence and frank talk. The U.S. has actually been frank with the Israelis at times, for instance by reprimanding them for striking the U.S.-supported Lebanese army more than 34 times since October. (Some of these strikes were likely by accident.)
But the possibility of the war in Gaza expanding to Lebanon is of such gravity and consequence that working to avoid it is — or at least should be — a top Biden administration priority. Given Hezbollah’s extensive arsenal, its 100,000-person army and decades of experience fighting Israel, a full-blown conflagration could get bloody quickly. Israel isn’t ignorant of the risks — there’s a reason why around 80,000 Israeli civilians were evacuated from their homes when the Israeli-Lebanese border started to become an active combat zone.
Even so, emotionalism is running high in Israel. While completely understandable, it’s also dangerous because emotion poisons prudent policymaking. The U.S. is continuing to press upon the parties to, if not de-escalate, then at least keep current hostilities confined to a limited area.
Ultimately, however, the spat between Israel and Hezbollah won’t be resolved through military means but by a diplomatic agreement that solidifies an internationally enforced buffer zone along the border. That is easier said than done.

Full text: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is traveling to the Middle East this week in part to press Israel to moderate its war plans in Gaza and prepare for a transition to lower-intensity operations against top Hamas commanders. President Joe Biden's administration is increasingly impatient about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a small coastal territory that has essentially become hell on earth.
The Israelis, meanwhile, are increasingly impatient about the situation in the north, near Israel's border with Lebanon. Ever since the war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, the Israeli military and Hezbollah, the Lebanese terrorist group that runs south Lebanon, have been firing at each other across the United Nations-demarcated border. Hezbollah drones and missiles, some of which are precision-guided, frequently target empty Israeli settlements and military posts. The Israelis quickly retaliate with airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons facilities, launch sites and Hezbollah cells preparing attacks. Approximately 94 Hezbollah fighters, as well as eight Israeli soldiers, have been killed in the bombardments, along with dozens of civilians. Tens of thousands of Israelis have evacuated the northern towns and kibbutzim near the Israel-Lebanon border.
Fortunately, the exchanges have been contained to the border region. But it doesn't take a geopolitical expert to understand that one errant rocket or airstrike with a high casualty rate could turn controlled escalation into chaos. Indeed, just as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is receiving pressure from some quarters to negotiate another truce with Hamas, Netanyahu is getting flak from Israelis in the north who want to return to their homes. Earlier in the war, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made the case that Hezbollah should be attacked preemptively to degrade the militia group's ability to conduct an Oct. 7-style attack in the north. That recommendation was ultimately rejected.
Yet as hostilities on the Israel-Lebanon border persist, Netanyahu may eventually have a change of heart. Gallant remains committed to his position, warning the United States, Lebanon, Iran and every state in between that "if the world doesn't get Hezbollah away from the border, Israel will do it."
An Israeli military spokesman was more ominous: "Hezbollah -- a proxy of Iran -- is dragging Lebanon into an unnecessary war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Lebanon." The statement amounts to a soft ultimatum to the world.
From Washington's standpoint, the ultimatum evokes mixed feelings. On the one hand, Hezbollah is the region's most formidable terrorist group, equipped with state-of-the-art missiles that can rain down fury on every major city in Israel. Yet on the other, a large-scale Israeli campaign against Hezbollah, even if it were warranted, is the last thing the U.S. wants right now. The Biden administration has invested significant diplomatic capital into containing the fighting to Gaza and preventing it from spreading to other faultlines in the Middle East. Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA Director William Burns, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown Jr. and President Joe Biden himself have all flown to the region in the hope of tamping down the flames of war. While all of these officials recognize that Israel has a responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism, none of them wants to see Israel take rash actions that could cause more problems and suck the U.S. into a war it would (rightly) rather avoid.
We should be under no illusions: If Israel were to act preemptively against Hezbollah, and the Lebanese militia group were to retaliate by launching some of the more than 150,000 missiles in its arsenal, it's highly likely the U.S. would get more directly involved on Israel's behalf. The U.S. military posture in the Middle East is already in a high state of alert and larger than it has been in years. Two aircraft carriers remain stationed in the region's waters, both carrying numerous fighter and bomber aircraft onboard. There are too many U.S. warships in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean to count, but all of them are equipped with the kinds of cruise missiles that would allow Washington to target Hezbollah positions at a relatively safe distance. The Biden administration has reportedly discussed possible military options against Hezbollah.
To date, all of those discussions are preliminary. This is what U.S. officials in the national security space do: They consider various contingencies and plan in the hopes that the worse-case scenario never occurs.
Averting the worse-case scenario, however, takes a lot of work, patience, persistence and frank talk. The U.S. has actually been frank with the Israelis at times, for instance by reprimanding them for striking the U.S.-supported Lebanese army more than 34 times since October. (Some of these strikes were likely by accident.)
But the possibility of the war in Gaza expanding to Lebanon is of such gravity and consequence that working to avoid it is -- or at least should be -- a top Biden administration priority. Given Hezbollah's extensive arsenal, its 100,000-person army and decades of experience fighting Israel, a full-blown conflagration could get bloody quickly. Israel isn't ignorant of the risks -- there's a reason why around 80,000 Israeli civilians were evacuated from their homes when the Israeli-Lebanese border started to become an active combat zone.
Even so, emotionalism is running high in Israel. While completely understandable, it's also dangerous because emotion poisons prudent policymaking. The U.S. is continuing to press upon the parties to, if not de-escalate, then at least keep current hostilities confined to a limited area.
Ultimately, however, the spat between Israel and Hezbollah won't be resolved through military means but by a diplomatic agreement that solidifies an internationally enforced buffer zone along the border. That is easier said than done.

Full text: When our family lived in Jerusalem in the mid-1990s -- where I was working as the Tribune's Middle East correspondent -- we were awed by the hope among both Israelis and Palestinians that the 1993 Oslo Accords might end their age-old conflict. The agreement signed on the White House lawn that year gave real hope for peace in modern times.
Then an extremist Jewish settler slaughtered 29 Palestinian men and boys as they knelt in prayer in a Hebron mosque in 1994. Hamas suicide bombers blew up buses to butcher Israelis on Jerusalem's streets. A Jewish extremist shot and killed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv in 1995. People on both sides overwhelmingly supported the Oslo process, but hateful extremists in each camp refused to share the Holy Land. So, they started killing Oslo. Thirty years later, its promise remains on life support.
Today, new extremists on both sides are determined to drive nails into any possible peaceful resolution to the conflict and the dream of a two-state solution. President Joe Biden must not let that happen. Too much is at stake. The impact of the brutal war raging in the destitute Gaza Strip echoes way beyond the Middle East and could radicalize a new generation of terrorists.
Since the bloody, barbaric attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 massacred 1,200 Israeli men, women, children and elderly near Gaza and touched off the war, there has been no concrete plan advanced by the combatants for the day after the fighting between Israel and Hamas stops -- whether it's weeks from now, or perhaps, months away.
Biden needs to start working forcefully now to outline that vision and build support for it among Israelis and Palestinians, as well as allies in the region and around the globe. Both sides must see a horizon with hope, security and justice, or they will face endless violence, war and death. There is no military solution to this conflict. Only a two-state endgame offers a viable, long-term political solution that could one day work -- even if, after all this trauma, it takes years to happen.
The president should lay out the strategy in a prime-time Oval Office address and call on moderate Arab states, the European Union and the U.N. for support. Arab states will not be eager to help fund the reconstruction of Gaza without a serious commitment to a two-state pathway.
It likely will require leadership changes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a longtime opponent of two states. That's a problem. His failure to focus sufficiently on Israel's security may have left Israel vulnerable to attack near Gaza, and his days as prime minister could be numbered. A formal commission of inquiry should await him at the end of the war. Israelis are demanding accountability. His popularity has fallen in polls, and 80% of Israelis believe he should accept responsibility for the staggering failures in security that led to the Oct. 7 attacks.
"The only way we believe there can be a successful vision for the day after is with a different Israeli government," said Adina Vogel-Ayalon, chief of staff of J Street in Washington, D.C., a pro-Israel, pro-peace organization advocating for U.S. policies that promote Jewish and democratic values for Israel.
"That is one of the many obstacles at this moment in time," she told me. "This Israeli government is resisting every plan for the day after that this administration has been promoting." J Street advocates for post-conflict arrangements that establish a path to an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel in the future, and steps to get there successfully.
In the middle of this horrifying war, this may seem like a pipe dream, but the sheer scale of this violence could ultimately shock the two parties into the realization that war is not the answer. The Yom Kippur War led, years later, to Camp David and an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
For the Palestinian Authority, increasingly ineffective and unpopular under President Mahmoud Abbas, elections must be held in the West Bank and Gaza after the war to revitalize the self-rule government, so eventually it can take over governing Gaza from a transitional authority of some kind when Israel pulls out. Netanyahu has said Israeli forces will stay there indefinitely, but Biden has rightly warned Israel not to reoccupy Gaza. That would be a mistake that could further radicalize Gazans and prolong conflict. Unlike Hamas, the Palestinian Authority is committed to a negotiated solution, and Biden envoys are right to seek a security role for it in Gaza.
By pledging America's ironclad support to Israel during the last 70 days of war in Gaza, the United States now owns this conflict too. The Biden administration must use its leverage with Israel to help end it, as soon as possible, once Israel decimates Hamas, and to help ensure a transition first to a multinational force, and ultimately, to the Palestinian Authority.
Israel has every right to defend itself. Hamas is a terrorist organization that has no interest in peace. Make no mistake, its goal is to kill Jews and destroy Israel. Its Oct. 7 attack was the deadliest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas has pledged to do it again. It puts Gazan civilians in the crossfire and hides under hospitals. Israel cannot and should not have to live with that threat on its border. America wouldn't.
Hamas took 240 hostages on Oct. 7, and an estimated 135 of them -- including 10 Americans -- remain captive in the dark tunnels under Gaza. The atrocities, rapes and murders of Israelis were unspeakable. Some of the dead were so badly burned or mutilated that they are only now being identified through DNA. The trauma is ongoing, and so are the funerals.
"Everyone walks around pretending to be normal," one Israeli friend told me, "but the whole country is suffering from trauma. It will be years until Israel begins to resemble its old self."
Israel's retaliation has been fierce. The Israeli military campaign has leveled much of Gaza's infrastructure and claimed the lives of at least 18,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gazan health officials. Some 80% of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced. Israel estimates thousands of Hamas fighters have died. Still, the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding there is raising alarm around the world. Biden's unwavering support remains strong, but his administration is calling on Israel for a more targeted strategy.
"I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives. Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful," Biden said last week, warning that Israel could lose international support because of the "indiscriminate bombing that takes place."
One Palestinian friend lost 14 members of his extended family in the bombing. "It's so painful," he wrote to me, "when one, every two or three hours, searches the lists of the death toll with fear of finding names of his relatives or friends."
The fear is that the longer this goes on, the more radical the Palestinian population will become, so that any plan for peace, stabilization and reconstruction the day after the war will be harder to achieve.
"I don't think there is a day after. I don't think this is going to stop," observed Rashid Khalidi, co-editor of the Journal of Palestine Studies and professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University. "I don't think the Israelis will bring resistance to an end. I don't think there is a stable Gaza coming.
"The fighters they kill will have little brothers and others who will go on fighting for years," Khalidi told me. "What they have done is produced a situation that is not going to have a clear end."
That is the challenge, but Biden has to forge bold diplomacy and lay out the road map for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians. There have been five wars over the past 15 years, and this is by far the deadliest. Clearly, Israel's strategy of blockading and containing Gazans in an open-air prison, as some call it, is not succeeding. Netanyahu's strategy has left Israelis more at risk.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has also warned Israeli leaders they might win a tactical victory against Hamas but risk "strategic defeat" in the long run if they fail to heed warnings about the impact of the rising civilian death toll.
The U.S. must support Israel's effort to degrade Hamas so that it is no longer a threat, but it should continue to urge a more careful military strategy within the bounds of international law to protect Palestinian civilians who had nothing do with the Hamas attack. The pressure campaign may eventually lead to another pause in the fighting to allow Hamas to give up more hostages, but Hamas leaders are not likely to leave Gaza. They know Israelis will hunt them down when they come out of their tunnels, as well it should. They must be driven out.
When the war ends, the U.S. must lead an international campaign to restore all humanitarian aid and rebuild Gaza, along with the Israeli communities attacked by Hamas. Israelis must have security guarantees they will be safe in the aftermath, and Palestinians must be offered hope for justice and self-determination in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
When distributing U.S. military aid, Biden should join a group of Democratic senators insisting it should come with zero tolerance for settler violence, settlement expansion, blockades and the expulsion of Arabs from their homes or villages. Some extremist, anti-Arab members in Netanyahu's coalition continue to provoke violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
Both sides deserve peace, economic opportunity and a safe place to raise their children. They pledged at Oslo to work together toward those goals. That work remains unfinished.
It may seem naive -- even a fool's errand -- to talk about peace plans at a time like this. The wounds on both sides are so deep, it may take years to get the parties back to the table, let alone trust that there is a true partner for peace on the other side. But that is the only way this ends without more violence, with a two-state outcome and two peoples living side by side in peace.

One Palestinian friend lost 14 members of his extended family in the bombing. "It's so painful," he wrote to me, "when one, every two or three hours, searches the lists of the death toll with fear of finding names of his relatives or friends."
The fear is that the longer this goes on, the more radical the Palestinian population will become, so that any plan for peace, stabilization and reconstruction the day after the war will be harder to achieve.
"I don't think there is a day after. I don't think this is going to stop," observed Rashid Khalidi, co-editor of the Journal of Palestine Studies and professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University. "I don't think the Israelis will bring resistance to an end. I don't think there is a stable Gaza coming.
"The fighters they kill will have little brothers and others who will go on fighting for years," Khalidi told me. "What they have done is produced a situation that is not going to have a clear end."
That is the challenge, but Biden has to forge bold diplomacy and lay out the road map for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians. There have been five wars over the past 15 years, and this is by far the deadliest. Clearly, Israel's strategy of blockading and containing Gazans in an open-air prison, as some call it, is not succeeding. Netanyahu's strategy has left Israelis more at risk.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has also warned Israeli leaders they might win a tactical victory against Hamas but risk "strategic defeat" in the long run if they fail to heed warnings about the impact of the rising civilian death toll.
The U.S. must support Israel's effort to degrade Hamas so that it is no longer a threat, but it should continue to urge a more careful military strategy within the bounds of international law to protect Palestinian civilians who had nothing do with the Hamas attack. The pressure campaign may eventually lead to another pause in the fighting to allow Hamas to give up more hostages, but Hamas leaders are not likely to leave Gaza. They know Israelis will hunt them down when they come out of their tunnels, as well it should. They must be driven out.
When the war ends, the U.S. must lead an international campaign to restore all humanitarian aid and rebuild Gaza, along with the Israeli communities attacked by Hamas. Israelis must have security guarantees they will be safe in the aftermath, and Palestinians must be offered hope for justice and self-determination in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
When distributing U.S. military aid, Biden should join a group of Democratic senators insisting it should come with zero tolerance for settler violence, settlement expansion, blockades and the expulsion of Arabs from their homes or villages. Some extremist, anti-Arab members in Netanyahu's coalition continue to provoke violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
Both sides deserve peace, economic opportunity and a safe place to raise their children. They pledged at Oslo to work together toward those goals. That work remains unfinished.
It may seem naive -- even a fool's errand -- to talk about peace plans at a time like this. The wounds on both sides are so deep, it may take years to get the parties back to the table, let alone trust that there is a true partner for peace on the other side. But that is the only way this ends without more violence, with a two-state outcome and two peoples living side by side in peace.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden's national security adviser advised Israel on Thursday to end its large-scale ground campaign in the Gaza Strip and transition to a more targeted phase in its war against Hamas, American officials said.
Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, did not specify a timetable during his meetings with top Israeli officials Thursday. But four American officials said Biden wants Israel to switch to more precise tactics within three weeks or soon thereafter. The officials asked for anonymity to discuss the president's thinking.
The new phase that the Americans envision would involve smaller groups of elite forces that would move in and out of population centers in Gaza, carrying out more precise missions to find and kill Hamas leaders, rescue hostages and destroy tunnels, the officials said.
The call for a change in tactics comes as differences between the United States and Israel have widened as the conditions in Gaza turn catastrophic. Biden said this week that Israel was beginning to lose international support because of the "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza, a much harsher assessment than his earlier public statements urging greater care to protect civilians.
Sullivan, who was in Israel on Thursday, spoke about a possible transition "in the near future, but I don't want to put a time stamp on it," said John Kirby, a White House spokesperson.
Shortly after The New York Times reported on the discussions, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that he "had made it clear that Israel will continue the war until we complete all of its goals."
And before meeting with Sullivan, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that the war against Hamas "will last more than several months," signaling determination to continue carrying out strikes in Gaza.
Gallant repeated Israel's arguments that destroying Hamas, the armed group that carried out the devastating Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, was essential to Israel's security and was difficult because Hamas has built an extensive underground infrastructure in Gaza.
U.S. officials said the Biden administration understands and accepts that Israel's efforts to hunt down Hamas leaders will continue for months, even after the transition from higher- to lower-intensity operations takes place.
Still, differences between the United States and Israel have widened in recent weeks over Israel's conduct of its war against Hamas and a postwar settlement for Gaza.
The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Mohammed Shtayyeh, said it's time for the United States to deal more firmly with Israel, particularly on Washington's calls for postwar negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"Now that the United States has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk," Shtayyeh said in an interview with The Associated Press a day before he and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were to meet with Sullivan.
Meanwhile, a three-day Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin appeared to end Thursday, and the Palestinian Health Ministry said that during the raid, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people and wounded 34 others.
Residents reported seeing Israeli military vehicles leaving the city Thursday afternoon, signaling an end to the unusually long operation inside Jenin and its refugee camp, a stronghold of Palestinian armed resistance in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military in a statement Thursday said it completed "a 60-hour-long extensive operation in the Jenin refugee camp and in the city of Jenin." It reported detaining "14 wanted suspects, including three affiliated with Hamas," as well as some 60 others during "hundreds of raids," and said it "eliminated 10 terrorists."
Seven Israeli soldiers were lightly injured in the operations that the military said "exposed more than 10 underground facilities, dozens of rifles," illicit funds and seven explosives labs.
More than 100 Palestinians were arrested during the raid, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club, a nongovernmental rights group.
Israeli military incursions in Jenin, commonplace for years, have become more frequent since the Hamas-led attacks Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel. The Israeli military describes the search-and-arrest operations as part of its counterterrorism efforts against Hamas in the West Bank.
Residents and local leaders in the Jenin refugee camp say the raids are aimed at displacing residents and making conditions there unlivable.
At least 78 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military raids in Jenin since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah, making it the deadliest period in the city in recent years. Across the West Bank, at least 286 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, most during Israeli raids but others in clashes with extremist Israeli settlers.
Israel's air and ground assault has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
Heavy fighting has raged for days in areas around eastern Gaza City that were encircled earlier in the war. Tens of thousands of people remain in the north despite repeated evacuation orders, saying they don't feel safe anywhere in Gaza or fear they may never be allowed to return to their homes if they leave.

Full text: Two months after the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, Israel’s well-documented reports of the atrocities of Oct. 7 continue to be questioned and even outright rejected as falsehoods.
Despite video evidence — recorded by the terrorists themselves — Hamas apologists continue to deny the killing of babies and the rape of women.
Opinion pages and social media have been rife with condescension. People somehow feel comfortable telling Jews that calling for the destruction of the world’s only Jewish state isn’t antisemitic, that antisemitic terrorism is actually resistance and that Jews provoked the slaughter of more than a thousand of their own. This must end.
If our society is to counter antisemitism effectively, it must first be understood. The American Jewish Committee’s newly republished Translate Hate glossary is designed specifically for this purpose. It is a tool to help people understand the true nature of antisemitism and why so many terms freely thrown around online are often antisemitic and dangerous to the Jewish community.
Take, for example, gaslighting. When Jews are told by others that what they have experienced is not antisemitism, that is gaslighting. It can present as telling Jews they cannot experience intolerance or bigotry because they are “powerful” or “privileged” — labels that often themselves come from antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jews. Human rights advocates usually defer to vulnerable minorities to define what bigotry against them looks like; Jews alone get pushback when they define antisemitism as they see it.
Gaslighting, along with an additional dozen other terms, was recently added to AJC’s Translate Hate glossary. These new entries include “settler colonialists” and “Globalize the Intifada,” which join pernicious slogans such as “From the river to the sea.”
The idea that Israel is a white settler colonialist state is born of ignorance. The opposite is true — Jews have called Israel home for millenniums. Historical and archaeological evidence have proved a continuous Jewish presence in the land, and this connection between Jewish people and the land of Israel is embedded throughout Jewish rituals.
The term “settler colonialism” also implies the intention to replace or even eliminate indigenous people. Zionism does not fit this model, since Jews themselves are also native and indigenous to the land of Israel and Zionists never had the goal of eliminating the Arab population living in the region. The founders of modern-day Israel accepted the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, which divided British Mandatory Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. Unlike European settler colonialists who settled colonies to enrich their motherlands and maintain a connection to their home countries, Jews who came to Israel were escaping persecution in Europe and returning to the land of their ancestors.
Far from a legitimate form of resistance, calls to “Globalize the Intifada,” in fact celebrate terrorism. Both the First and Second Intifadas were organized campaigns of violence against Israeli civilians — including suicide bombings of cafes, buses, and hotels. Those calling for a global intifada are, knowingly or not, advocating for terrorism and more dead Jews.
“From the River to the Sea” is a rallying cry for terrorist groups such as Hamas and their sympathizers. It demands the establishment of a state of Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, erasing the State of Israel and its people. This is not a call for peace, nor for a two-state solution; it is a call for one state, free of all Jews. Its goal is ethnic cleansing.
This battle for truth is not an academic exercise. If people doubt Jews when they define antisemitism, it’s no wonder they doubt Israelis, even when the overwhelming evidence of antisemitic terror stares the world in its face.
The Israeli government, aware of the double standard to which it is held, cannot afford to be careless with facts. Hamas, on the other hand, an internationally recognized terror organization created to destroy Israel and massacre Jews, too often receives the benefit of the doubt despite a long history of exaggerations and fabrications, coupled with rape and murder.
Just two months into the Israel-Hamas war, how many times have Hamas apologists had to backpedal after sharing false information? From the accusations of mass murder to allegations of false flag attacks, claims of Israeli duplicity have been proven false time and again.
Reports of Hamas’s brutality, on the other hand, have been repeatedly documented and proved.
The rush to judgment against Israel was evident after the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital. International news outlets at first accused Israel of purposely bombing the hospital and killing 500 people, a narrative provided by a single source: Hamas.
It turned out, of course, that the explosion was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. News sources were forced to rescind their initial reporting, but they didn’t learn their lesson.
Barely a month later, Israel was accused of exaggerating, if not lying, about a Hamas command center at the Al-Shifa Hospital. Yet, true to their word, the Israeli military provided evidence of a substantial tunnel network and weapons caches at the site.
There is no doubt that Israel is a reliable source and that Hamas is not. So what could explain why a terror organization gets the benefit of the doubt where a democratic nation does not?
Antisemitism.

Truth and accuracy in language matter, especially in times of great suffering, and we all must commit to seeing the situation with clear eyes.
Who do you trust to accurately report on the events on the ground? Mass-murdering, propagandizing, genocidal terrorists? Or Israelis who lived through the atrocities of Oct. 7?
Who do you trust to define antisemitism? Jews, who have suffered under it for millenniums, or non-Jews who don’t understand that pain?
Some of today’s most common anti-Israel rhetoric is actually a mutation of older forms of antisemitism.
Jews, unfortunately, understand all too well how to translate the anti-Jewish hate that has reared its ugly head for millenniums. We just need the world to listen.

Israel part of funding plan propping up Hamas: Qatari payments for Gaza encouraged by Netanyahu for years

Full text: TEL AVIV, Israel -- Just weeks before Hamas launched the deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the head of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, arrived in Doha, Qatar, for a meeting with Qatari officials.
For years, the Qatari government had been sending millions of dollars a month into the Gaza Strip -- money that helped prop up the Hamas government there. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not only tolerated those payments, he had encouraged them.
In the Mossad chief's meetings in September with Qatari officials, according to several people familiar with the talks, chief David Barnea was asked an unexpected question: Did Israel want the payments to continue?
Netanyahu's government had recently decided to continue the policy so Barnea said yes. The Israeli government still welcomed the money from Doha.
Allowing the payments -- billions of dollars over roughly a decade -- was a gamble by Netanyahu that a steady flow of money would maintain peace in Gaza, the eventual launching point of the Oct. 7 attacks, and keep Hamas focused on governing, not fighting.
The Qatari payments, while ostensibly a secret, have been discussed in the Israeli news media for years. Netanyahu's critics disparage them as part of a strategy of "buying quiet," and the policy is in the middle of a ruthless reassessment following the attacks. Netanyahu has lashed back, calling the suggestion he tried to empower Hamas "ridiculous."
In interviews with more than two dozen current and former Israeli, U.S. and Qatari officials, and officials from other Middle Eastern governments, The New York Times unearthed new details about the origins of the policy, the controversies that erupted inside the Israeli government, and the lengths that Netanyahu went to in order to shield the Qataris from criticism and keep the money flowing.
The payments were part of a string of decisions by Israeli political leaders, military officers and intelligence officials -- all based on the fundamentally flawed assessment that Hamas was neither interested in nor capable of a large-scale attack. The Times has previously reported on intelligence failures and other faulty assumptions that preceded the attacks.
Even as the Israeli military obtained battle plans for a Hamas invasion and analysts observed significant terrorism exercises just over the border in Gaza, the payments continued. For years, Israeli intelligence officers even escorted a Qatari official into Gaza, where he doled out money from suitcases filled with millions of dollars.
The money from Qatar had humanitarian goals, including paying government salaries in Gaza and buying fuel to keep a power plant running. But Israeli intelligence officials now believe that the money had a role in the success of the Oct. 7 attacks, if only because the donations allowed Hamas to divert some of its own budget toward military operations. Separately, Israeli intelligence has long assessed that Qatar uses other channels to secretly fund Hamas' military wing, an accusation that Qatar's government has denied.
"Any attempt to cast a shadow of uncertainty about the civilian and humanitarian nature of Qatar's contributions and their positive impact is baseless," a Qatari official said in a statement.
Multiple Israeli governments enabled money to go to Gaza for humanitarian reasons, not to strengthen Hamas, an official in Netanyahu's office said in a statement. He added: "Prime Minister Netanyahu acted to weaken Hamas significantly. He led three powerful military operations against Hamas which killed thousands of terrorists and senior Hamas commanders."
Hamas has always publicly stated its commitment to eliminating Israel. But each payout was a testament to the Israeli government's view that Hamas was a low-level nuisance, and even a political asset.
As far back as December 2012, Netanyahu told prominent Israeli journalist Dan Margalit that it was important to keep Hamas strong, as a counterweight to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Margalit, in an interview, said Netanyahu told him that having two strong rivals, including Hamas, would lessen pressure on him to negotiate toward a Palestinian state.
The official in the prime minister's office said Netanyahu never made this statement. But Netanyahu would articulate this idea to others over the years.
While Israeli military and intelligence leaders have acknowledged failings leading up to the Hamas attack, Netanyahu has refused to address such questions. And with a war waging in Gaza, a political reckoning for the man who has served as prime minister for 13 of the past 15 years, is, for the moment, on hold.
But Netanyahu's critics say that his approach to Hamas had, at its core, a cynical political agenda: to keep Gaza quiet as a means of staying in office without addressing the threat of Hamas or simmering Palestinian discontent.
"The conception of Netanyahu over a decade and a half was that if we buy quiet and pretend the problem isn't there, we can wait it out and it will fade away," said Eyal Hulata, Israel's national security adviser from July 2021 until the beginning of this year.
Netanyahu and his security aides slowly began reconsidering their strategy toward the Gaza Strip after several bloody and inconclusive military conflicts there against Hamas.
"Everyone was sick and tired of Gaza," said Zohar Palti, a former director of intelligence for Mossad. "We all said, 'Let's forget about Gaza,' because we knew it was a deadlock."
After one of the conflicts, in 2014, Netanyahu charted a new course -- emphasizing a strategy of trying to "contain" Hamas while Israel focused on Iran's nuclear program and its proxy armies, including Hezbollah. This strategy was buttressed by repeated intelligence assessments that Hamas was neither interested in nor capable of launching a significant attack inside Israel.
Qatar, during this period, became a key financier for reconstruction and government operations in Gaza. One of the world's wealthiest nations, Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and, of all its neighbors, has cultivated the closest ties to Hamas. These relationships have proved valuable in recent weeks as Qatari officials have helped negotiate for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.
Qatar's work in Gaza during this period was blessed by the Israeli government. Yossi Kuperwasser, a former head of research for Israel's military intelligence, said: "The logic of Israel was that Hamas should be strong enough to rule Gaza," he said, "but weak enough to be deterred by Israel."

Full text: ISTANBUL -- Much of the Gaza Strip lies in ruins, with its people pushed from their homes by Israeli bombardment and the death toll climbing ever higher. On the ground, Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years, has largely vanished, other than when its fighters pop up to attack Israeli tanks or fire rockets at Israel.
But the group is still reaping benefits from its surprise attack Oct. 7 on Israel. It is regarded as the only Palestinian faction to squeeze concessions from Israel in many years. It has thrown a bloody wrench into Israel's plans to improve relations with its Arab neighbors and forced the Palestinian issue back onto the agendas of world leaders.
Two months into the war, despite vows by Israeli officials to destroy Hamas, Israel has yet to kill its top leaders, free the remaining 137 hostages Hamas holds or provide convincing evidence that it can achieve its goal of eliminating Hamas without an astronomical human cost.
In Hamas' cynical calculation, the loftiness of Israel's aims is a plus. While sticking to its long-term goal of destroying the Jewish state, Hamas can declare victory merely by surviving to fight another day.
"There is always going to be an advantage that an unconventional force will have, particularly if it is as ruthless as Hamas and doesn't really care about the damage to the local civilians," said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a Middle East policy analyst who grew up in Gaza. "Israel is going to be stuck in this unwinnable war, causing massive death and destruction."
What exactly Israel can achieve remains an open question. But simply prosecuting the war can, over time, damage Israel's economy and international standing, while encouraging a new generation of Palestinians to hate Israel -- all benefits for Hamas.
The Hamas-led surprise attack on Oct. 7 was the deadliest day in Israel's history, with about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, killed and 240 taken hostage. Israel responded with a military ferocity not seen anywhere in decades, dropping thousands of bombs on Gaza and launching a ground invasion to destroy Hamas' military and governing structures.
The war has been catastrophic for Gaza's 2.3 million people. About 85% have fled their homes and now face a growing challenge to find food, water, shelter and medical care. More than 17,900 people have been killed, more than two-thirds of them women and children, according to the territory's health authorities, who do not report how many of the dead were combatants.
The war has taken a toll on Hamas too.
The group has largely abandoned governance in Gaza, but remnants of its police force still work in the south, and medics in hospitals overseen by the health ministry struggle to treat floods of wounded patients. Otherwise, it is increasingly leaving the strip's people to fend for themselves.
But fighters from Hamas and other armed factions continue to attack Israeli forces inside Gaza and have killed more than 90 soldiers.
Israel has yet to find and kill Hamas' top leaders in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar, the highest-ranking Hamas official in the territory, and Mohammed Deif, who leads the group's armed wing. Israel considers both men architects of the Oct. 7 assault and of the fighting in Gaza since.
Sinwar has not appeared publicly since the war began.
But one hostage, Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old peace activist, told an Israeli newspaper after her release last month that Sinwar had come to the tunnel where she was being held. She said she asked him if he was ashamed to have done such a thing to people who had supported peace. Sinwar did not answer, she said.
Coordination continues between Hamas members in and outside of Gaza, which allowed leaders based in Qatar to negotiate exchanges of hostages for prisoners that Hamas in Gaza then carried out. The group's media teams churn out news updates, statements from leaders, and videos of attacks and civilians killed in Israeli strikes. Hamas officials in Turkey and Lebanon communicate their views to journalists and diplomats, and the group's leaders in Qatar speak regularly with mediators from Qatar and Egypt about potential cease-fires and exchanges of captives.
At a restaurant in Beirut this past week, Hamas hosted a public seminar to assess the "accomplishments and challenges" of the war so far.
Ahmad Abdul-Hadi, a Hamas representative, told the dozens of attendees that the battle represented a "qualitative shift" in the struggle against Israel and that Hamas and the Palestinians had accepted the sacrifices necessary to keep the Palestinian cause alive.
"The Palestinian people and their resistance had to take a costly strategic decision because the costs of liquidating the Palestinian cause and squandering Palestinian rights would be much greater," he said.
Of course, Gaza's civilians had no say in Hamas' decision to attack Israel, and some have complained that they are paying the price, despite the risk of speaking out against the group.
"Why are they hiding among the people?" an unidentified man covered in dust in a hospital told Al Jazeera. "Why don't they go to hell and hide there?"

Full text: Josh Jury, of Homewood, said he was looking forward to celebrating Hanukkah in Israel this year while he was there for a study aboard program.
But the Israel Hamas war forced him to flee from Israel and finish his semester at URJ Heller High, a high school educational experience for Jewish sophomores, juniors and seniors to learn in Israel, remotely.
"I was just really excited to celebrate in Israel," Jury said. "But now I'm with my family, and I think more than ever it's important that we're together."
Thursday evening was the start of Hanukkah, the eight-day Jewish holiday known as the festival of lights. It was also two months to the day when Hamas militants stormed through the blockaded Gaza strip into Israel, initiating a surprise land and air attack.
Jury also pointed out the war began on the Jewish holiday Simhat Torah. But the war has solidified for Jury the importance of continuing Jewish celebrations and traditions, he said.
"I remember when I was in Israel on Simhat Torah, someone said to me, 'The whole point in these missiles being fired into Israel is to prevent us from celebrating a holiday, to prevent us from holding a Jewish space,' " Jury said. "We need to keep celebrating. We need to keep celebrating our identities."
The story of Hanukkah is of the Maccabees, or Jewish soldiers, fighting and winning a war against the Greeks over Jerusalem, Jury said. During the war, a miracle occurred when one drop of oil lasted eight nights, said Rabbi Jenny Steinberg-Martinez, with Joliet Jewish Congregation.
Jury said it's all about hope and miracles.
"Hanukkah is all about resisting hate, so it's like fighting back oppression and having safe space for Jewish people and Jewish tradition," Jury said. "I think there's a lot of people hoping for a miracle with this war that it's just going to end."
Steinberg-Martinez said Hanukkah has become a bigger celebration in the United States, compared to Israel, because Hanukkah competes with Christmas. Hanukkah is a time for children to learn more about their Jewish heritage and traditions, she said.
But, with the back drop of the war, Steinberg-Martinez said the story feels even more important this year.
"I think it's a great message for what's going on, because it really does seem kind of hopeless to a lot of people," Steinberg-Martinez said. "Hanukkah is a great opportunity to reflect on when there's light there's hope. Miracles do happen. Things can change."
Had he been able to stay in Israel for Hanukkah, Jury said he'd likely spend time with friends singing songs, lighting the Menorah and going to parties. What he was most looking forward to was going with friends to bakeries to eat sufganiyot, an Israeli doughnut eaten during Hanukkah.
Now that he's back home, Jury said he looks forward to celebrating Hanukkah with his family. Growing up, Jury said his grandmother hosted the family for a Hanukkah party. Since her passing seven years ago, Jury said his parents took over the role of hosting.
"I'm really grateful to be safe and to be spending the holiday with my family," Jury said.
With the war, Steinberg-Martinez said the Jewish community looks forward to finding a moment of joy and continuing to pray for peace.
"I think people are just exhausted from the news and from the coverage. I think they are relieved it seems like some people are being released and that there's some movement," Steinberg-Martinez said.
While many in the Jewish community are feeling hopeless, Steinberg-Martinez said it's important to remember, like the story of Hanukkah, anything is possible.
"It only takes one drop of light to dispel an entire room of darkness. Hanukkah is a great message that we can change things," Steinberg-Martinez said.

Full text: It was late September when students at the Ida Crown Jewish Academy in Skokie gathered to watch a documentary on the Yom Kippur War, which was fought 50 years earlier between Israel and a coalition of Arab states. As part of the presentation, the school's dean, Rabbi Leonard Matanky, told the students how at the time -- he was a sophomore at the school in 1973 -- the senior class traveled to Israel to support the war effort.
Less than two weeks after the documentary screening, Israel was attacked by Hamas on Oct. 7. The students returned to school following that weekend with a question for Matanky: "When are we going?"
"The students are the ones who came to me and wanted to volunteer," Matanky said. "We quickly started talking about what we could do."
The result of that planning is an upcoming nearly monthlong trip to Israel, in which about 70% of the senior class will travel to the country to help in the agricultural sector and other parts of the economy in desperate need of workers.
"What's happening in Israel today is that between the 300,000 reservists who were called up and Arab workers who are not able to travel the way they were before, the country is very short-staffed in a lot of places," Matanky said. "Agriculture is critical because of the growing season."
The 40 senior class members on the trip will be living at the Kibbutz Kfar Etzion near Jerusalem from Dec. 17 to Jan. 11. Their schedule will include three days a week working in agriculture, a day helping with the children of evacuees or soldiers, and a day in food service.
"Going to a warm weather place this time of year is usually done to relax," Matanky said. "This is to do farm work. This is manual labor. They are all giving up their vacations this year to serve a greater purpose."
The response from both the parents and students to the idea of volunteering in Israel has been overwhelmingly positive, Matanky said.
"It wasn't even a decision," said Orah Katz, the mother of Adam Katz, a senior making the trip. "Once we got the initial email saying this was a possibility, we were on board."
Adam Katz was one of the seniors who approached Rabbi Matanky about traveling to Israel.
"There's a lot you can do here to fundraise and make a difference, but it's not like going there and doing something that's real," he said. "Money is great, but it's not going to pick vegetables."
"I didn't even think twice about it," said Deva Zwelling, whose daughter Jordana will go on the trip.
"(Our kids) have grown up wanting to support Israel, whether it's writing letters to soldiers or raising money for institutions. This is a defining moment in a teenager's life," said Josh Zwelling, Jordana's father. "You get an opportunity to take everything you've learned about and talked about for so long into real action. She was for it from the beginning, and we were as well -- I don't think we debated it for a second."
"(The senior class) all talked about how we've visited the country during the good times and about the amazing things going on there," said Jordana Zwelling. "It's so important to show up and be there for the times that are bad as well. We can't just watch from afar."
"I feel like it's my duty to go and help," said senior Ayelet Appel. "There are people my age who are serving in the army. The minimum I can do is go over and help with whatever people need."
"Here, we kind of feel hopeless," said Ayelet's mother, Hamutal Appel. "We can do some things here, but it's not enough. Having the opportunity to send a child to help will make a difference."
Matanky said he believed that the Ida Crown Jewish Academy is the first high school in the United States to organize such a trip to Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks, although he expects more to follow suit in the months ahead.
"I think this is an opportunity for students to make a difference, and I expect other schools will be looking to help in any way they can," he said.
While the students will be keeping a busy schedule in Israel, they aren't neglecting their academic responsibilities. A dozen faculty will join the seniors for various parts of the trip, and students taking Advanced Placement classes will have time to keep up with their studies through online tutorials.
"We want the students to learn what it means to give of themselves, but at the same time, we don't want to miss out on what's important to them academically," Matanky said. "We've also found access to a gym, so those on the boys' and girls' basketball team and the wrestling team can continue training while they're over there."
He also hopes that the trip will help the students establish a stronger connection to their faith and the Jewish community.
"They know they're part of a community, and I'm hoping that this opportunity will give them one of the most important lessons we could ever teach them," he said. "You are part of something bigger, and you have a responsibility to that thing. In this case, it's the state of Israel."
The war in Israel has also brought about a change in how many perceive the safety of Jews in this country.
"We're seeing more acts of antisemitism now," said Joseph Rothner, a senior going on the trip. "It has brought out the worst in people."
"It's sad to say, but I think that in some ways, (the students) are safer in Israel than in going to a college campus now," said Josh Zwelling.
"We've definitely noticed the difference," said Orah Katz. "We've had two Jewish flags ripped off of our car. You no longer necessarily feel safe as a Jewish person."
Other parents told similar stories of feeling uncomfortable with anti-Israeli sentiments expressed to them in public.
"In Israel, you know what's going on, you know where you stand," said Seth Appel, Ayelet's father.
"Here, you don't know who your enemies are," said Hamutal Appel. "You feel safer there because you know where to stay away. Here, it could be right in front of us, and you have no idea."
While not questioning the decision to go, some students are understandably still concerned about traveling to a country at war.
"I'm a little nervous about going to a war zone, but I'm confident that the school isn't going to put us in any dangerous situations, " Jordana Zwelling said. "They're going to do their best to keep us safe. I'm really excited to go."
"I believe it's going to be one of the highlights of their schooling years," Matanky said. "It's something that will stay with them forever."

Full text: Good afternoon, Chicago.
An executive for the Texas-based owners of the Burger King at the center of the ex-Ald. Ed Burke corruption trial told the jury today he went against his own boss’s instructions to hire Burke’s law firm for property tax work on a “gut feeling” about their competence.
The Burger King scheme was back in the spotlight today as the corruption trial entered a fourth week of testimony. Prosecutors had interrupted their presentation of the Burger King episode after an attorney for one of Burke’s co-defendants, Peter Andrews Jr., fell ill with COVID-19 over the Thanksgiving break.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats in Congress are clashing with each other and the Biden administration over a push from the left that would attach conditions to an emergency infusion of security aid for Israel during its war with Hamas, the latest reflection of a growing rift within the party over support for the Jewish state.
The debate is a striking departure from long-standing practice on Capitol Hill, where for decades, lawmakers have approved huge amounts of military funding for Israel with few strings attached. Now, as Israel battles Hamas in a conflict whose civilian death toll has soared, a growing number of Democrats are voicing worry about how American dollars will be used.
The issue could come to a head on the Senate floor as early as next week, when Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, has said the chamber could begin work on a legislative package including the aid measure.
The disagreements among Democrats simmered behind closed doors on Capitol Hill and at the White House on Tuesday.
At the White House, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, huddled with roughly 20 Democratic senators who have raised concerns about how Israel might use U.S. assistance on the battlefield. Later, at a private party lunch in the Capitol, several of the same Democrats argued to their colleagues that any aid package should increase humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip and ensure that Israel do more to avoid civilian casualties.
"We want the president to secure express assurances from the Netanyahu government regarding a plan to reduce the unacceptable level of civilian casualties, and we want the Netanyahu coalition to commit to full cooperation with our efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who is leading the effort, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. "The bottom line is we need those express assurances. How we achieve that is something that we are discussing right now."
Van Hollen spearheaded a letter this month to President Joe Biden that was signed by half of the Democratic caucus and raised concerns about whether the weapons provided by the United States would be used in keeping with international law.
The Biden administration has requested $14.3 billion for Israel's war against Hamas as part of a sweeping national security package that includes additional billions in humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
No Democrats have said they would not back the package. But several have worried that if left unchecked, Israel's use of heavier, U.S.-supplied offensive weapons funded by a fresh infusion of American money could undermine efforts to minimize Palestinian casualties and distribute help to civilians under bombardment.
Their concerns have become the latest flashpoint in a debate within the Democratic Party about how much restraint Israel should exercise in its strikes on Gaza. Leaders of both parties have dismissed calls for conditions as unnecessary and warned that they would hamstring Israel's military strategy.
"There are different views on that," Schumer told reporters Tuesday after the lunch. "The bottom line is I'm going to discuss it with the administration and my caucus."
Republicans, eager to showcase Democratic divisions on the issue, have been far more blunt.
"If Senate Democrats want to vote to tie the hands of Israeli soldiers as they defend their country against vicious terrorists, I welcome such a debate," Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, said in a floor speech. "Israel deserves the time, space and resources to restore its security, and I will stand by our ally 100%."
Israel has been the United States' largest cumulative recipient of foreign aid since its founding in 1948, and the $3.8 billion it receives in annual military assistance outpaces the amount given to any other nation, with the recent exception of Ukraine. Although some of those funds were approved on the heels of peace deals, Congress has not previously detailed terms restricting the conditions under which the weapons Israel procures from the United States can be used.
But that could change as some Democrats push for an explicit assurance that Israel's operations against Hamas not run afoul of international law in the assistance package.
"Those are goals that I think everyone shares, and we're just trying to figure out the best way to do it," said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who signed the letter to Biden.
The Biden administration, though initially unequivocal in its support of Israel's efforts to rout Hamas from Gaza, has recently urged Israel to be more surgical in its strikes, to avoid exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis. Last week, Biden told reporters that the idea of conditioning aid to Israel was "a worthwhile thought."
Some leading congressional Democrats argue that the Biden administration has already done enough to ensure that Israel conducts its operations in a way that spares civilian suffering.
"The Biden administration has had good conversations with the Israelis. I think he's had impact on the military strategy as well as humanitarian assistance," said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin has vocally opposed putting restrictions on additional weapons for Israel.
"We don't condition aid on an ally, and we're not going to try to micromanage their defense," Cardin said.

Commentary: What will happen after the Israel-Hamas truce expires?

Full text: Last week, I questioned whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas would be able to hammer out a short-term truce that would include the simultaneous release of hostages on both sides. We received the answer last Tuesday. Working through Qatar, Egypt and the United States, Israel and Hamas reached an agreement that has paused the fighting for six days, compelled Hamas to release more than 50 women and children in its custody (in return for the release of 150 Palestinian women and minors in Israeli jails) and increased the flow of desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Now, I have one more question: What will happen once the arrangement expires?
Compared with the first six weeks of the war, the mood today is a bit brighter — or as bright as it can be under such depressing circumstances. The six-day truce, painfully negotiated over a period of weeks with multiple breakdowns along the way, has worked fairly well. Whatever violations or disagreements that existed have been resolved quickly thanks to Qatar’s diligence as a mediator, which has proved indispensable throughout.
At the time of writing, Hamas has freed more than 50 hostages, including 4-year old American Abigail Edan. More than 100 Palestinian women and minors, most of whom were locked up for nonviolent offenses, have seen their sentences cut short and have been sent back to their families. Trucks continue to stream into Gaza carrying much-needed food, water and fuel, although at this point in the two-month-old war, no amount of aid will compensate for the fact that most of Gaza’s 2 million people are now essentially homeless. Gaza’s reconstruction and rehabilitation will be an expensive and time-consuming task, more so with every day of war that passes.
The humanitarian truce is good news in an otherwise horrific situation, and it has led to some cautious optimism about what could be in store over the coming weeks. During the Thanksgiving holiday, President Joe Biden expressed his hope that the Israel-Hamas truce would be pushed into this week, which in turn could grease the wheels for an end to the war and a more comprehensive resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
An unnamed Qatari official at the center of the diplomatic effort had a similar assessment: “Our hope is that we build on this progress and the momentum of the last 48 hours can be sustained to extend the pause once the current deal expires and lead to further discussions about a more sustainable agreement to end the violence and bloodshed of civilians.”
On Monday, on the last day of the original four-day truce, those prayers for a longer pause in hostilities were granted. The extension will provide another two days for Hamas to locate and release more hostages, some of whom are being held by smaller Palestinian militant factions. The development serves the interests of both sides. Israel will get more of its citizens out of Hamas’ clutches and perhaps lessen the international opprobrium over its military operations there; Hamas militants will get to breathe for a few more days without Israeli bombers flying overhead.
But let’s assume for a moment that the truce continues to be extended. What then?
The perpetual optimists among us are anticipating or at least hoping that a few more days of calm will eventually entice Israel and Hamas to cut a more comprehensive cease-fire agreement. A cease-fire, in turn, could serve as a catalyst toward broader talks between Israel and the Palestinians, in which the contours of an ever-elusive two-state solution could be drawn up. This is obviously the best-case scenario.

Unfortunately for the optimists, it’s also the least likely. Indeed, given the utter lack of goodwill on both sides and the current political leadership dominating Israel and the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, one could even use the word “delusional.”
For one, Israel has no intention of cutting a cease-fire deal with Hamas. Not now, not ever again. Netanyahu has been down this road on multiple occasions; every single major war with Hamas over the last 15 years (2008-09, 2012, 2014, 2021) eventually ended with a cessation in the fighting that was supposed to establish calm on both sides of the Israel-Gaza border. That worked, until it didn’t. Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel has upended Netanyahu’s containment policy. The strategy Israel employed in the past, a combination of military sticks and economic carrots, is no longer politically sustainable.
Everything Israeli officials have said in the days since the humanitarian truce was implemented suggests Israel retains the same overall objective: Overthrow Hamas rule in Gaza and destroy the organization in its entirety. According to Gen. Herzi Halevi, Israel’s top military officer, Israel will “return immediately at the end of the cease-fire to attacking in Gaza, operating in Gaza.” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant offered much the same sentiment in his remarks: “Any further negotiations will be under fire. Meaning, if they (Hamas) want to continue discussing ... it will be while bombs fall and the forces are fighting; that’s the basis.”
Hamas isn’t about to stop fighting either. Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top military official, is a dead man walking. He knows any cease-fire proposal short of Hamas’ full surrender and total demobilization will be rejected outright by the Israelis. Having brought misery, death and further deprivation to Gaza’s people, Hamas is now arguably in its weakest position since it took control of the enclave in 2006.
The bottom line: While the last several days of respite shouldn’t be minimized or overlooked, we would be kidding ourselves if we thought the end of this war was near. That’s the blunt truth.

Full text: The joy unleashed in Israel this weekend with the release of some Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip has created a dilemma for Israel's leaders, analysts say.
For now, Israel is set to continue its invasion of Gaza after a four-day truce that ends Tuesday morning.
But the terms of the truce also allow for the cease-fire to be extended.
Israel has said it was prepared to grant another day's pause for every 10 hostages that Hamas releases beyond the 50 outlined in the agreement.
"The question is day five," said Alon Pinkas, an Israeli political commentator and former senior diplomat. "Does Israel resume the war?"
An extension that allows for more hostage releases would give further relief to those Israelis who see the hostages' freedom as Israel's biggest immediate priority.
That sentiment could spread more widely among the Israeli population as each day of the cease-fire passes, and more hostages are released.
"And Hamas knows this very well," said Shira Efron, a senior researcher at Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based political research group. "They're going to play with Israel and say, 'Oh, we found another five kids. If you give us another day, there are a few in the north that we can find.' "
Efron said, "There's a very high likelihood that on day five, on day six and on day seven, we're going see an extension of this."
Some families have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of not doing enough to bring hostages home.
But a longer pause could jeopardize the primary goal of Israel's military campaign in Gaza: the destruction and dismantling of Hamas, the armed Gaza-based group that led the Oct. 7 raid that killed an estimated 1,200 people in southern Israel and led to the abduction of roughly 240 hostages.
If the cease-fire lasts longer than four days, Hamas -- which controlled all of Gaza until Israel invaded it last month -- would have more time to regroup, allowing it to mount a fiercer defense when and if Israel does resume its military campaign.
An extended cease-fire is also expected to create more opportunities for foreign powers -- particularly the United States -- to pressure Israel to scale back its military goals. The Israeli response to the Oct. 7 attack has killed more than 13,300 in Gaza, according to health officials there, leading to rising alarm among Israel's allies about the conduct of Israel's campaign.
Women and minors have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in Gaza. The figure does not include updated numbers from hospitals in the north, where communications have broken down.
President Joe Biden, speaking Friday from Nantucket, Massachusetts, said "the chances are real" that the pause could open the door to a longer cease-fire.
But even if the U.S. does push Israel to end or moderate its military campaign, Israel's leaders may nevertheless ignore the criticism and plow ahead with the invasion.
To end the war now would leave Hamas still in charge of most of Gaza. It would also bring forward the postwar recriminations -- including a state inquiry into who was to blame for the Oct. 7 attack -- that could prove damaging to Netanyahu, his military chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, and other security chiefs.
By proceeding with an invasion, even if it delays further hostage releases and heightens international criticism of Israel, Israeli leaders could delay that push for accountability and potentially salvage some of their domestic reputation, particularly if they end up ousting Hamas.
It would also delay a difficult conversation about who should run the parts of Gaza that Israel has captured -- a dilemma that no Israeli leader has conclusively addressed in public.
For Israeli leaders, the war is "all about eradicating and destroying Hamas," Pinkas said. "So anything less than that is not a win. If Hamas maintains and retains residual political power, then Hamas can claim they won."
After the initial elation of the hostage releases wears off, the Israeli public may still overwhelmingly back resuming the invasion, even if it prevents the immediate liberation of more Israeli captives.
As more hostages are released, Israelis will hear more accounts of how they were treated during their abduction and captivity -- accounts that could well amplify calls for Hamas' destruction, Efron said.

Full text: Colorful sticky notes lined a glass wall in a central gathering area at Ida Crown Jewish Academy in Skokie. Each bore the name of an Israeli soldier who was known to a student, their friend or a relative.
At Universal School in Bridgeview, Amira Daoud was soliciting ideas from her students at the Islamic school for new decor for the wall outside her classroom. Fall leaves, the middle school students suggested, but the leaves would be in the colors of the Palestinian flag and would include messages to the children of Gaza.
The walls at each school carry tangible signs of a war thousands of miles away that has become a constant presence in the lives of many Chicago-area students. At some Jewish and Islamic schools the war plays a central part in students' school days, as they seek deeper understanding of a complex, long-running conflict, navigate fear and worry about family members in Gaza or Israel.
"There's so much racism going on and segregation," said Ayelet Appel, a senior at Ida Crown, later adding: "The world was progressing, so why are we going back now?"
The conflict has loomed large at Ida Crown and Universal since the terrorist group Hamas
attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking a war between Israel and Hamas that has devastated much of the Gaza Strip.
Hamas kidnapped an estimated 240 people, killed some 1,200 others and shattered Israel's sense of security in its attack. Israeli airstrikes and a ground invasion in Gaza have killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and women and children have consistently made up about two-thirds of those killed in the health ministry's reports.
Some 6,000 people have been reported missing, feared buried in rubble. The figures do not include updated numbers from hospitals in the north of Gaza, where services and communication largely broke down earlier this month.
Violence also erupted in the West Bank, and attacks by Israeli settlers in the occupied territory have surged at an unprecedented rate, according to the United Nations.
A four-day cease-fire was expected to begin Friday, a day later than originally announced. Hamas was to release 50 hostages in stages in exchange for what Hamas said would be 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Those released first were expected to be women and minors.
Before the cease-fire, the death toll of the war reached Illinois. Six-year-old Wadea al-Fayoume, a Palestinian American boy, was stabbed to death in unincorporated Plainfield Township, and his mother seriously injured. Prosecutors said the boy's landlord became "heavily interested" in the war after regularly listening to conservative talk radio, and stabbed the mother and son.
The rhythm of the days at Ida Crown and Universal illustrates some of the ways Jewish and Islamic students are grappling with the war and the fallout at home in Chicago.
The Tribune was unable to visit Universal because, teacher Deanna Othman said, the school is seeking to protect students after a neighboring school received a threatening hate letter, and amid concerns about media representation and the possibility of becoming a target. But the paper spoke with two teachers and a student at the school by phone.
The school day at Universal begins with morning prayers over the loudspeaker. Since the onset of the war, they have included prayers for Gaza, for the safety of those living there, that they have food and to take away their pain.
Students have raised money for humanitarian causes in Gaza through bake sales and a fundraiser allowing students who donate to show up at school out of uniform. Teachers have run into their students at some of the frequent, high-profile rallies, protests and other actions in Chicago supporting Palestinians in Gaza and calling for a cease-fire, including a recent major rally that blocked DuSable Lake Shore Drive.
Students arrive at school wearing kaffiyehs, black and white kerchiefs that can be a symbol of Palestinian nationalism, or shirts over their uniforms expressing support for Palestinians or with the colors of the Palestinian flag.
Across Illinois' large Muslim community, the toll of the war has hit home. The state has more Muslims per capita than any other state in the U.S., and Palestinians are believed to make up about 60% of the Arab American population in metro Chicago.
Some were among the thousands who attended a large rally in Washington, D.C., calling for a cease-fire, and many are experiencing overwhelming grief as the war has progressed and relatives are killed or missing in Gaza.
At Universal, Reena, a senior, has been trying to balance showing up at school each day with fear for her aunts, uncles, cousins and family home in Gaza.
Her family watches the news constantly and spends most of their time trying to get in touch with the family they left behind, who they are able to contact only intermittently when there is enough electricity in Gaza to send messages.
They often don't know where, exactly, their family is.
Reena is caught between wanting to stay home all day watching the news and waiting for a message from family, and wanting to go to school and live her life.
"Probably the hardest part is just showing up every day and trying to put on a front that everything is OK, when one second you could have a family and the next second you don't," she said.
Navigating the scale of mourning in the community has been difficult, she said. But students have come together, sharing articles and comfort. Not every student has family in the region, but all of them feel affected.
Reena and her family requested she be identified only by her first name to protect her identity.
"It's definitely not easy, because this is a war," she said. "There's a lot of feelings going around. There's a lot of thoughts going around. Lots of preconceived notions, lots of everything. So it's definitely difficult navigating life when a part of your identity might be accepted by people, it might not be. Or might be targeted, or it might not be. I'm sure the same goes for someone who identifies as an Israeli or a Jew."
Daoud, who teaches seventh grade math and science, said the war has come up often in her classes. Many of her students know she is active in the organization American Muslims for Palestine and began asking questions about Gaza and the war, and what it meant that Israel imposed a siege on Gaza, severely limiting food, medicine, water and other basic supplies.
So Daoud decided to dedicate one of her science classes to a lesson about the history and geography of Gaza and why Palestinians are crammed into the small, densely populated stretch of land.
When Daoud asked her students to reflect on the lesson, she learned one of them had an aunt and cousins in Gaza.
"I think it was actually more calming for (my students) because they understood (the conflict)," she said. "And I think part of the worry beforehand was maybe not understanding why this was happening."
Othman, a high school English teacher, found it hasn't been hard to integrate current events into her AP English literature class.
They were already doing a unit on colonialism and exile on Oct. 7, reading poets and authors of various ethnicities who wrote about feeling detached from their homeland.
The concepts already were relevant to her students, Othman said, then she saw them play out in real time in the media as she found representations of Muslims, Palestinians and the war frustrating, inaccurate, Islamophobic and dangerous.
The killing of Wadea al-Fayoume was one example of the consequences of inaccurate and Islamophobic media, she said. Her students were shaken and afraid. Some attended the funeral at a mosque near the school.
"How dangerous it is to be misrepresented," she said. "Hateful language leads to hateful actions."
Othman taught a session about media literacy for students. Other seminars for high school students have focused on the war, including spoken-word performances.
"It's a constant presence in our school," she said. "I can't even say that there's a particular time or period that it comes up in. It's pretty much, for me, our entire day. Our entire existence for most of our staff and our students."
Othman, who is also involved in the group American Muslims for Palestine, has family in Gaza, and her four children visited over the summer.
It has been difficult for her and her students to concentrate on assignments and curriculum as the war has unfolded, and she has apologized to her students for needing longer than usual to return graded assignments, she said.
Counselors check in with students they know are connected to the war, and students have space to take a rest if they need a minute of quiet to compose themselves.
Counselors notify teachers about students who might need extra time for assignments, or who are struggling with the war but don't want to discuss it, or who are trying to help parents who are struggling with the news, she said.
Daoud and Othman both expressed concerns about media representation of the war, and Daoud worries for other students. There is comfort at Universal in knowing students and teachers are surrounded by others also pulling for Gaza and Palestinians, she said, but she worries that Muslim and Palestinian students at public schools might not have the ability to express support as freely.
"We feel that our victimhood is constantly questioned, and that we have to kind of be the perfect victims in order for the world to understand what we're going through and what our situation is like," Othman said.
At Ida Crown, students and the dean, Rabbi Leonard Matanky, were also concerned about representation in media. One of many events the school has held since Oct. 7 included inviting a school alumnus who leads a media watchdog group focused on coverage of Israel to speak.
Students have written letters to Israeli soldiers and students, and an alumnus who is in the army spoke to students via videoconference. History classes have been dedicated to learning about the history of the conflict, and students have raised money for Israel and emailed government officials.
The school has also taken students to pro-Israel rallies, including a mid-November "March for Israel" in Washington attended by an estimated tens of thousands of supporters. A group of seniors attended a Chicago City Council meeting where aldermen approved a symbolic resolution backing Israel. The meeting became emotional and often unruly as the council was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters, and the chamber was eventually cleared.
Some of the students who attended said it was a scary encounter.
The students said they were taken to a separate space while the room was cleared and found the wait terrifying. Some of the angst at the meeting felt directed at them.
Noa Gavant said it brought her to tears, and Jordana Zwelling said it put her studies of the Holocaust into a new light.
"It's kind of hard to understand how someone could hate someone for just being a Jew," she said. "And then we got to City Hall, and kind of like, I understood it. I was like, wow, there's really just a strong sense of hatred just because of your religion, and it has nothing to do with your character as a person."
Views in the Jewish community have differed in the aftermath of Oct. 7, as pro-Israel rallies have attracted tens of thousands of supporters and others, including some in Chicago, have attracted Jewish protesters expressing solidarity with Palestinians.
Ida Crown seeks to educate students about Israel and give students an opportunity to express their solidarity, Matanky said. Nearly everyone in the school has a relative in Israel, and most students spend a gap year there after graduating.
Students said they get frequent updates from friends who live in Israel. They have brothers, grandparents, aunts and uncles there. Millo Benmelech was "very, very nervous" for his family.
In December, Matanky plans to take a group of seniors to Israel for several weeks to volunteer in the country. Some students said it felt like their duty, a place they needed to be, even if some felt nervous.
"It's personal," Matanky said.
In late October, Matanky led a discussion among several seniors about the conflict. Intertwining articles, texts and teachings from the Torah, they discussed language they viewed as politically charged and the threat they perceived from Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and which they viewed as wanting to wipe out a Jewish state.
The students also grappled with the idea of moral equivalency, and the ethical dilemma and pain posed by killing moral, righteous and innocent Palestinians while the Israeli military fights Hamas.
All the while, Matanky sought to instill pride in Israel in the students.
Israel is a safe haven, said one of the students, Adam Katz, and students worried about the threat of losing that.
It was a home for Benjy Baronofsky's great-grandparents, who moved to Israel after surviving the Holocaust, he said.
"That really just shows the importance of Israel to us as Jews," he said. "It's the one place where we know we're safe; where we know we'll be accepted."
Amid fear for their families and friends in Israel, the students wondered what a conversation with Palestinian students might be like. It would be difficult in a heated environment, but it might be necessary, some said.
"Palestinians who live here, who also have family that is being affected by it, we probably share a lot of the same things," Appel said. "Like worrying about your family and seeing all these different things in the media and being conflicted, not knowing what to believe and what not to believe. We probably have a lot of similarities. We just have that differing belief of the solution."

Full text: Talking with your enemy during wartime is one of the most psychologically stressful things for a combatant to do. Haggling with the same people trying to kill you leaves a bad taste in the mouth. And yet, more times than not, talking and fighting at the same time is a necessity, both to explore possible avenues out of the war and to win back the release of hostages or soldiers in enemy hands.
Despite the rhetoric from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel also has a dialogue going with Hamas, the terrorist group that swept into southern Israel and committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. While Israeli and Hamas officials aren't talking to each other directly, they are using intermediaries such as Qatar to deliver messages, exchange proposals and see whether a deal over hostages is possible.
While nobody knows how many hostages Hamas has in its custody, the number is thought to be around 240 people. Many of them are civilians of all ages, from babies to senior citizens. Where those hostages are being held is also a mystery, but the Israelis suspect a good portion are housed in the labyrinth underground tunnel system Hamas has constructed in the 17 years the group has ruled Gaza.
All of this presents a problem for the tens of thousands of Israeli troops combing northern Gaza: How can Israel square an intense military offensive in a densely populated area with the goal of bringing innocent civilians back to their families alive?
It took longer than some would have liked, but Netanyahu appears to have come around to the conclusion that getting the hostages out through diplomatic means is the best way to square the circle. Up until a week or so ago, Netanyahu was highly resistant to the notion of negotiating with Hamas. But Hamas was never going to release hostages for free; captured Israelis are highly valuable for a group that, in the past, has been able to trade them for Palestinian prisoners. The most infamous case study came in 2011, when Netanyahu approved the transfer of about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to win the freedom of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas five years earlier. One of those Palestinian prisoners was Yahya Sinwar. Hamas' top military official and the architect of the Oct. 7 assault on Israel.
Netanyahu didn't want to repeat the episode. According to The New York Times, there was a draft agreement on the table that would have transferred 50 hostages to Israel in return for a temporary pause in Israeli airstrikes. But for a variety of reasons, including doubt that Hamas' negotiators actually had the power to negotiate on anything, the deal died. Israel launched its ground invasion soon after.
The talks, however, didn't die. Over the following weeks, rumors of a possible hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas have percolated. The terms have largely been the same: Hamas hands over the civilian hostages (Israeli troops are also held) in phases in exchange for a multiday pause in Israel's military campaign and an increase in humanitarian aid into Gaza. U.S. officials are more optimistic about a hypothetical deal today than they have been in the past.
"Many areas of difference that previously existed have been narrowed," deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CBS' "Face the Nation" program over the weekend. "We believe we are closer than we have been to reaching a final agreement."
The outstanding question hovering over all of this is whether the technicalities of any agreement can be resolved. Ushering dozens, if not hundreds, of civilian hostages through a war zone is no easy feat. Evacuation routes need to be established, and fighting would need to stop along those routes until the process is complete. Israel is reportedly insisting on aerial surveillance to ensure the hostages are going where they need to go; Hamas is balking at such a monitoring plan.
The length of any fighting pause is also up for dispute. Hamas would obviously like the pause to be as long as possible in order to recuperate some of the military capability it has lost. Israel wants the pause to be on the short end for precisely the same reason. Enforcing any short-term truce is also going to be an impossible task. There is no third-party mediator able to pull it off. In the past, truces between Israel and Hamas lasted -- until they didn't.
Politics are also at play. Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, doesn't have the same internal limitations as Netanyahu does. Whereas Sinwar seems to have a solid hand on the organization's political and military wings, Netanyahu doesn't have a solid hand on anything. Israel's longest-serving prime minister is in an unenviable position: Any decision he makes will be viewed by someone, somewhere, as the wrong one.
If he doesn't sign a deal with Hamas, Netanyahu will feel the full weight and anger of the families who have long since grown tired of his government's ineptitude and lack of compassion. Sign a deal, and Netanyahu risks getting hammered by his far-right coalition partners as a weakling who has caved to Hamas' antics.
The second scenario is not hypothetical; when Netanyahu approved the daily delivery of a measly two fuel trucks into Gaza to ensure the enclave's sewage and water systems were running, he was condemned by folks like National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir as an appeaser giving aid and comfort to the terrorist enemy.
Netanyahu will have to make a judgment call. One hopes he listens to common sense instead of extremists.

Full text: JERUSALEM -- For 17 years, on and off, two men maintained a secret line of communication between Israel and Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that opposes Israel's existence.
Starting in 2006, Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist based in Jerusalem, and Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official in the Gaza Strip, nurtured an informal back channel between officials in Jerusalem and in Gaza, even as each side refused to engage.
The men's relationship survived countless rounds of violence between Israel and Hamas, and helped end several of them.
Even after Oct. 7, when Hamas and its allies raided Israel, killed an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapped roughly 240 others, according to Israeli officials, Baskin and Hamad kept in contact, including discussing a deal to release some hostages. As Israeli warplanes pounded Hamas-controlled Gaza, killing more than 10,000 Palestinians according to Gaza's health authorities, their unlikely relationship endured. Then, something snapped.
The impact of the Hamas-led attack has shattered the idea that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be perpetually contained without being resolved. It has since displaced more than 1.5 million, mostly in Gaza, and brought the Middle East to the brink of a regional war.
And one of its more intimate consequences has been the falling out between Baskin and Hamad.
On Oct. 24, Hamad began publicly justifying Hamas' assault and calling for more attacks. "The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears. It is Israel, not us," he said, adding, "Everything we do is justified."
Baskin later watched the interview, aghast.
"I think you have lost your mind and you have lost your moral code," he wrote in a text message to Hamad that Baskin later showed to The New York Times.
"I never want to speak to you again," Baskin added.
Throughout their relationship, a long-term truce, if not a lasting peace, between Israel and Hamas seemed plausible; it was an idea that the two had personally discussed.
Not anymore.
On Oct. 24, Hamad, once considered a Hamas moderate, said he wanted to annihilate Israel. And Baskin, a leftist, has joined the Israeli mainstream in calling for the removal of Hamas.
"In my mind, they can no longer exist as a government next to Israel," Baskin said in an interview.
"His stance has changed," Hamad said in a separate interview. And, Hamad added, "He sensed how I changed."
The two men encountered each other in July 2006, during one of the first full-scale conflicts between Hamas and Israel. Hamas had captured an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, prompting Israel to invade the territory.
Seeking to negotiate a cease-fire but unable to call Israeli leaders directly, a Hamas spokesperson instead phoned a well-known Israeli peace activist.
The spokesperson was Hamad. The activist was Baskin. And Hamad immediately charmed Baskin by declining to speak in Arabic or English.
"I like to speak Hebrew," Hamad said, by Baskin's recollection.
It was an early flash of common ground between two men from markedly different backgrounds.
Baskin was born in 1956 to a Jewish family in New York. He studied Middle Eastern politics and history at New York University before emigrating to Israel in 1978.
Hamad was born in 1964 in southern Gaza and had no meaningful contact with Israelis as a child. Hamad trained as a vet in Sudan before joining Hamas in 1987, the year it was founded, according to an interview with Hamad in Baskin's book, "The Negotiator." In 1989, Hamad was held for Hamas activism and spent five years in an Israeli prison.
As both men matured, they each developed an aptitude for mediation.
After arriving in Israel, Baskin worked as a community organizer in an Arab village. Then he began a career fostering relations between Arabs and Jews, running a research group that promoted solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and sometimes acting as a formal mediator.
While in prison, Hamad got to know Israelis for the first time. He learned Hebrew and English, and became a spokesperson for inmates in their dealings with prison authorities.
David Meidan, a senior Israeli intelligence officer, said the years of conversations between Baskin and Hamad had once paid off.
"The key word is trust," Meidan said. "They had trust between them."

Full text: President Harry Truman was fond of referring to State Department employees derisively as the "striped pants boys." That antagonism was sometimes mutual, as was the case in May 1948, when Truman granted de facto American recognition of the newly established state of Israel. This was done to the chagrin of many in the State Department, where anti-Zionist sentiment was rampant.
Indeed, according to Truman biographer David McCullough, tensions between the White House and the State Department grew extremely fraught during this period. White House officials were accusing career State Department employees of antisemitism, while the State Department believed the White House was more concerned with domestic political considerations -- i.e., the Jewish vote.
In the end, Truman's prerogative as president won out. As he would later write, "The problem with many career officials in government is that they regard themselves as the men who really run the government." Truman continued: "I wanted to make it plain that the President of the United States, and not a second or third echelon in the State Department, is responsible for making policy."
Seventy-five years later, tensions between State Department employees and the White House are again threatening to boil over -- and once again, it is over the Jewish state. Last month, an 11-year veteran at the State Department, Josh Paul, publicly resigned over the Biden administration's policy of standing in solidarity with Israel. In a scathing resignation letter, Paul denounced the administration for its "blind support" for the Israelis over Palestinians.
That was just the opening salvo. This week, news broke that dozens of State Department employees have been circulating internal memos to Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. This isn't just yelling into the void. Blinken has met in person with at least some of these signatories, which might be a tacit admission that the problem won't fizzle out on its own.
Such developments threaten to undermine President Joe Biden's strong stance in defense of Israel. In the wake of the Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7, the president responded resolutely by sending an American aircraft carrier to the region and boldly reaffirming U.S. support for Israel. More recently, however, that support seems to come with more and more caveats.
In private conversations with their Israeli counterparts, American officials are warning that Israel is running out of time before support erodes for its military operations. Publicly, Biden has urged Israel to avoid civilian casualties, which, of course, Israel already understands is crucial to retaining international support. This past week, the president observed that Gaza's hospitals "must be protected," even as the Israeli military was battling Hamas militants outside the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, which sits atop one of Hamas' underground headquarters.
It's not just the executive branch that's struggling to keep its ranks in order. The New York Times recently detailed the extent to which congressional staffers are breaking with their bosses over support for Israel. Recently, more than 100 congressional staffers took part in a walkout to protest the stance on Israel held by the members of Congress they work for. "Our constituents are pleading for a cease-fire," said a few of the aides. "We are the staffers answering their calls."
Delusions of grandeur aside, this is reflective of a generational shift for Democrats on the issue. In recent years, the party's base has shifted dramatically to the point in which, according to pollster Gallup, a majority of Democrats now support Palestinians over Israel. That's a significant shift from just 10 years ago, when Democrats favored Israel by 35 percentage points.
For Democrats, it's past time for the adults in the room to reassert control. From the White House to Capitol Hill, our elected officials cannot be strong-armed by their subordinates. In the coming months, the U.S. will have to make tough decisions in regard to the Middle East.
Americans deserve to know where the buck stops.

Army leads tour at hospital in Gaza: Israel: Underground shaft, staircase on grounds of complex

Full text: GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- Almost 48 hours after entering Gaza's largest medical complex, the Israeli military escorted journalists from The New York Times through a landscape of wartime destruction Thursday night to a stone-and-concrete shaft on its grounds with a staircase descending into the earth -- evidence, it said, of a Hamas military facility under the hospital.
But Col. Elad Tsury, commander of Israel's 7th Brigade, said Israeli forces, fearing booby traps, had not ventured down the shaft at the hospital, Shifa. He said it had been discovered earlier in the day under a pile of sand on the northern perimeter of the complex.
In the darkness, it was unclear where the shaft led or how deep it went, although the military said it had sent a drone down at least several yards. Electrical wiring was visible inside, along with a metal staircase. The controlled visit will not settle the question of whether Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that rules the Gaza Strip, has been using Shifa Hospital to hide weapons and command centers, as Israel has said.
The claim is central to Israel's defense of the death toll caused by its military campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 11,000 people, according to health officials in Gaza. Israeli officials say the extreme loss of life has been caused in part by Hamas' decision to hide its military fortifications and command centers inside civilian infrastructure.
Hamas denies the accusation and says Israel is committing war crimes by targeting civilian facilities such as hospitals.
The Israeli military has said that Hamas used a vast maze of tunnels underneath the hospital as a secret base, but since announcing early Wednesday that its troops had entered the grounds, the military has yet to present public documentation of such an extensive network. As the international community increasingly demands protections for civilians in Gaza, Israel is under pressure to demonstrate that the hospital -- and the tunnel network it said it concealed -- were important enough military targets to justify the immense cost in Palestinian lives.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israeli forces had found proof of their allegations about Shifa. There were "a lot of terrorists there," he said in an interview with National Public Radio, but "they fled as our forces approached the hospital."
"We found a lot of weapons -- a lot," he added. "We found a lot of ammunition. We found bombs. We found on level minus-two a command and control center of Hamas, with military encoded encryption."
Tsury acknowledged the pressure on Israel to show evidence of Hamas activity at the hospital, but said it might be days before troops descended the shaft. He added that soldiers were searching the complex and had discovered weapons, explosives and computers, as well as the body of an Israeli hostage in a building. The military announced Friday that soldiers had found a second hostage's body in a building near Shifa.
Another military official said Israeli troops had captured and interrogated a Hamas operative at the hospital but offered no further detail.
To enter Gaza, two reporters and a photographer for the Times were obliged to remain with Israeli troops for the duration of the visit. They agreed not to photograph most soldiers' faces, landmarks, maps and certain details of weapons. The Times did not allow the Israeli military to screen its coverage before publication.
The Times journalists were allowed to see only a portion of the sprawling Shifa complex. The military refused to let the journalists explore the hospital, or see or interview patients and medical staff who remain in the facility, saying it had not been fully secured and that Hamas combatants might still be there.
Before Israel's raid on Shifa, the World Health Organization said that it had ceased to be a functional hospital. Officials described desperate conditions: Food, medicine and anesthetics had all but run out, and generators and lifesaving equipment had been shut down because of a lack of fuel. Some three dozen premature babies were at particular risk, they said.
Tsury said the military had provided food, supplies and medical equipment to patients and doctors, an assertion that could not be immediately verified.
The extent of the damage to the hospital was not entirely clear. But its main emergency building appeared intact, with electricity, after a dayslong siege that health officials say had resulted in increasingly dire conditions.
Gunfire rattled nearby throughout the Times' visit, giving the impression of ongoing gunbattles in nearby streets. To enter the hospital grounds, special forces officers escorted journalists through the bombed-out remains of a building on the outskirts of the site; they said it was too dangerous to pass through the main gate.
Away from the hospital, the scale of the destruction had rendered parts of Gaza unrecognizable. Apartment buildings have been hollowed out by shelling and others flattened by airstrikes.

Full text: GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- Almost 48 hours after entering Gaza's largest medical complex, the Israeli military escorted journalists from The New York Times through a landscape of wartime destruction Thursday night to a stone-and-concrete shaft on its grounds with a staircase descending into the earth -- evidence, it said, of a Hamas military facility under the hospital.
But Col. Elad Tsury, commander of Israel's 7th Brigade, said Israeli forces, fearing booby traps, had not ventured down the shaft at the hospital, Shifa. He said it had been discovered earlier in the day under a pile of sand on the northern perimeter of the complex.
In the darkness, it was unclear where the shaft led or how deep it went, although the military said it had sent a drone down at least several yards. Electrical wiring was visible inside, along with a metal staircase.
The controlled visit will not settle the question of whether Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that rules the Gaza Strip, has been using Shifa Hospital to hide weapons and command centers, as Israel has said.
The claim is central to Israel's defense of the death toll caused by its military campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 11,000 people, according to health officials in Gaza. Israeli officials say the extreme loss of life has been caused in part by Hamas' decision to hide its military fortifications and command centers inside civilian infrastructure.
Hamas denies the accusation and says Israel is committing war crimes by targeting civilian facilities such as hospitals.
The Israeli military has said that Hamas used a vast maze of tunnels underneath the hospital as a secret base, but since announcing early Wednesday that its troops had entered the grounds, the military has yet to present public documentation of such an extensive network. As the international community increasingly demands protections for civilians in Gaza, Israel is under pressure to demonstrate that the hospital -- and the tunnel network it said it concealed -- were important enough military targets to justify the immense cost in Palestinian lives.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israeli forces had found proof of their allegations about Shifa. There were "a lot of terrorists there," he said in an interview with National Public Radio, but "they fled as our forces approached the hospital."
"We found a lot of weapons -- a lot," he added. "We found a lot of ammunition. We found bombs. We found on level minus-two a command and control center of Hamas, with military encoded encryption."
Tsury acknowledged the pressure on Israel to show evidence of Hamas activity at the hospital, but said it might be days before troops descended the shaft. He added that soldiers were searching the complex and had discovered weapons, explosives and computers, as well as the body of an Israeli hostage in a building. The military announced Friday that soldiers had found a second hostage's body in a building near Shifa.
Another military official said Israeli troops had captured and interrogated a Hamas operative at the hospital but offered no further detail.
To enter Gaza, two reporters and a photographer for the Times were obliged to remain with Israeli troops for the duration of the visit. They agreed not to photograph most soldiers' faces, landmarks, maps and certain details of weapons. The Times did not allow the Israeli military to screen its coverage before publication.
The Times journalists were allowed to see only a portion of the sprawling Shifa complex. The military refused to let the journalists explore the hospital, or see or interview patients and medical staff who remain in the facility, saying it had not been fully secured and that Hamas combatants might still be there.
Before Israel's raid on Shifa, the World Health Organization said that it had ceased to be a functional hospital. Officials described desperate conditions: Food, medicine and anesthetics had all but run out, and generators and lifesaving equipment had been shut down because of a lack of fuel. Some three dozen premature babies were at particular risk, they said.
Tsury said the military had provided food, supplies and medical equipment to patients and doctors, an assertion that could not be immediately verified.
The extent of the damage to the hospital was not entirely clear. But its main emergency building appeared intact, with electricity, after a dayslong siege that health officials say had resulted in increasingly dire conditions.
Gunfire rattled nearby throughout the Times' visit, giving the impression of ongoing gunbattles in nearby streets. To enter the hospital grounds, special forces officers escorted journalists through the bombed-out remains of a building on the outskirts of the site; they said it was too dangerous to pass through the main gate.
Away from the hospital, the scale of the destruction had rendered parts of Gaza unrecognizable. Apartment buildings have been hollowed out by shelling and others flattened by airstrikes.

Full text: A Skokie man who attended a Solidarity with Israel rally in Skokie on Oct. 22 is facing four counts of felony charges for allegedly discharging pepper spray at pro-Palestinian counter-protestors. His lawyer said his client will plead not guilty to the charges.
Zevulen Ebert, 33, of the 5000 block of Oakton Street, Skokie, was back in Cook County court on Nov. 16 to schedule his arraignment, where he will enter a guilty or not guilty plea. A grand jury voted to formally indict Ebert on two felony charges of aggravated battery and two charges of hate crimes.
Ebert’s lawyer, Hal Garfinkel, said that prosecutors will not be able to prove Ebert had any criminal intent for the alleged crime.
At a pretrial hearing on Oct. 25, Garfinkel said the charges were sought out by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office to satisfy political pressures arising from the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
Skokie police arrested Ebert on Oct. 22 near the Ateres Ayala kosher event hall on Touhy Avenue, where the Midwest Regional Office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center was holding a solidarity with Israel event.
Ebert was released from custody three days later at his first pre-trial in late October and was not given a requirement for electronic surveillance.
A document from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said Ebert was waving an Israeli flag in front of pro-Palestinian supporters when a person tried to come up behind Ebert and take his flag.
A verbal exchange followed and Ebert discharged pepper spray, which the document says injured multiple people and more than one Chicago police officer. Ebert accused Palestinians of war crimes and gave “obscene middle finger gestures,” according to the court document.
Ebert will be back in court for his arraignment to enter his plea on Nov. 27. An arrest does not constitute a finding of guilt.

Full text: Student and faculty speakers at an event held in the Bergland Auditorium of Indiana University Northwest’s Savannah Center on Thursday night condemned the Israeli government’s ongoing assault on the Gaza strip and called for an end to the violence.
“Immediate cease-fire now is the minimum,” Raoul Contreras, chair of IUN’s Minority Studies Department, told an audience of around three dozen people.
Contreras cited the position of Raz Segal, an Israeli professor of Holocaust and genocide studies, who has labeled Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a textbook case of genocide.”
For the past month, the Israeli Defense Forces have conducted a campaign of airstrikes against the Palestinian territory, killing an estimated 11,000 people according to Gaza’s health ministry, almost all of whom have been civilians. The assault was prompted by an October 7 attack on Israeli soldiers and civilians by Hamas, the terrorist group that governs Gaza. Hamas militants broke through the territory’s heavily fortified border with Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking over 240 back to Gaza as hostages. News of the massacre horrified Jewish residents of Northwest Indiana, many of whom have relatives in Israel or other ties to the country.
“We are all still reeling, especially as more information becomes available,” Emily Benedix, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana, told the Post-Tribune. “Our Jewish community has been very touched by the outpouring of support from the non-Jewish community in Northwest Indiana. It’s been absolutely encouraging and meaningful beyond what we can express.”
The past month’s violence has been the latest flare-up in a struggle spanning three quarters of a century between the nation of Israel and the stateless Palestinian people. In November of 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted to divide the British-controlled territory of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. Jewish nationalists in the region embraced the plan but Palestinian Arabs, who at the time outnumbered the region’s Jews, rejected it as a land-grab. Violence between the two groups broke out and after Israel declared independence the following year, five Arab states attacked the new country.
The war ended with an Israeli victory, and resulted in the permanent displacement of roughly 700,000 Palestinians, more than half of the group’s total population, with refugees emigrating abroad or settling in the Gaza strip and West Bank. In 1967, an Israeli victory in another war with its Arab neighbors led to the country occupying the Gaza strip and West Bank, the latter of which remains under occupation with partial control by the Palestinian National Authority. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintains control over the movement of people and goods into and out of the territory through a blockade. Various Palestinian factions have employed both violent and nonviolent means in an effort to secure statehood.
Among those displaced in 1948 were the family of Dana Safi, a Palestinian American IUN student who grew up in Munster. She told the Post-Tribune that she still has relatives in the Gaza strip, though they are not in close contact with her family in the United States. News of the Oct. 7 attacks left Safi with a profound sense of dread.
“I distinctly remember like waking up that day just reading all the news and my first thought was ‘this is going to be extremely bad for every single Palestinian.’” she said. “Hamas doesn’t speak for the Palestinian people and a lot of Palestinians, they don’t like the idea of fighting back because we know that we’re going to get hit harder.”
Less than two weeks later, the Palestinian death toll of the ensuing Israel-Hamas war had already surpassed that of the third war fought between the two in the summer of 2014, when 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed, according to data from the United Nations. The Gaza strip, roughly twice the size of Washington D.C., has a population of over 2 million people, nearly half of whom are children. Safi, a sophomore studying philosophy, said that her family has been monitoring Facebook for news from the territory, and learned that a relative was likely killed on Sunday.
The violence in Israel and Gaza has had reverberations far closer to home. On Oct. 14, less than 60 miles from IUN’s campus in unincorporated Plainfield, Illinois, 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume was stabbed to death by his landlord, according to the Will County Sheriff’s office. His mother, Hanaan Shahin, was also stabbed and was hospitalized with nonlife threatening injuries, in what authorities have labeled an anti-Palestinian hate crime. Joseph Czuba, 71, pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges and faces life in prison if convicted.
“I’m just afraid of identifying as Palestinian because you never know who has a vendetta against me,” Safi said, adding that her parents have cautioned her against displaying her support for Palestine in public out of concern for her safety. She chose to attend the event, she said, “because if anyone’s gonna speak out, it needs to be the people who have a direct relation.”
Two other Palestinian American IUN students, both of whom have family in the West Bank, offered condemnations of Israel and support for the Palestinian people at the event.
“The international community must prioritize the importance of a cease-fire for the sake of the innocent lives at stake and to alleviate the immense suffering in Gaza,” said Naseeb Mohammed, a first generation American studying accounting and finance. “It’s our shared responsibility to work toward a just and lasting solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one that recognizes the dignity and humanity of everyone involved and paves the way for peace and coexistence in the line of Palestine.”
Ahmad Abudayyeh was born in the West Bank and moved to the United States as a preteen. He drew a sharp distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people as a whole, lamenting the harm done by the former. He argued, however, that Israel’s 16-year blockade of Gaza — defended by the Israeli government as a means of denying Hamas access to weapons — contributes to violence.
“I do believe that all Israeli lives and all Palestinian lives matter,” he said. “but I truly believe that keeping 2.2 million people in an open-air prison will create radicalism.”
Benedix stressed that her organization supports the right of pro-Palestinian students and faculty to voice their views in public, but pushed back against a number of the event’s talking points.
“What my concern is when I hear the term ‘genocide’ and actually several of these slogans that we’re hearing and all the inflammatory language, is that it is something that’s meant to engage raw emotion without context,” she said. Blame for the month of violence, she said, belongs squarely on Hamas, whose violence she described as “animalistic and barbaric.”
“I would challenge anyone to say that those actions can be justified by anything,” she said. “We’re not talking about the civilians. We’re talking about the people that did these horrific actions.”
It is incumbent on the militant group, she said, to end the violence by returning Israeli hostages.
Jewish voices have long been among the most prominent on both sides of debates in the United States over American support for the Israeli government — the U.S. supplies Israel with more than $3.8 annually in military aid — which have become increasingly heated in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks and. On Oct. 18, the pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League — one of the nation’s oldest Jewish civil rights groups — issued a condemnation of Jewish pro-Palestinian protesters who occupied the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building in Washington to demand a cease-fire. President Joe Biden has staunchly resisted such calls and has pledged “rock solid and unwavering” support for Israel.
Ruth Needleman, a professor of labor studies at IUN, invoked her own Jewish identity in condemning Israel’s attacks on Gaza at Thursday’s event.
“I have no identification with Israel. It’s not my country. They don’t speak for me and they don’t speak for the majority of Jews in the world,” Needleman said. “To attack the policies of the government of Israel is to be against genocide, not to be anti-Semitic.”
An IUN spokesperson did not comment on the event’s content, and wrote in a statement that it “was not university-sponsored.”
“It was conducted in accordance with normal procedures for events in that venue, which encourage the free and civil exchange of ideas,” she wrote.

“I’m just afraid of identifying as Palestinian because you never know who has a vendetta against me,” Safi said, adding that her parents have cautioned her against displaying her support for Palestine in public out of concern for her safety. She chose to attend the event, she said, “because if anyone’s gonna speak out, it needs to be the people who have a direct relation.”
Two other Palestinian American IUN students, both of whom have family in the West Bank, offered condemnations of Israel and support for the Palestinian people at the event.
“The international community must prioritize the importance of a cease-fire for the sake of the innocent lives at stake and to alleviate the immense suffering in Gaza,” said Naseeb Mohammed, a first generation American studying accounting and finance. “It’s our shared responsibility to work toward a just and lasting solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one that recognizes the dignity and humanity of everyone involved and paves the way for peace and coexistence in the line of Palestine.”
Ahmad Abudayyeh was born in the West Bank and moved to the United States as a preteen. He drew a sharp distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people as a whole, lamenting the harm done by the former. He argued, however, that Israel’s 16-year blockade of Gaza — defended by the Israeli government as a means of denying Hamas access to weapons — contributes to violence.
“I do believe that all Israeli lives and all Palestinian lives matter,” he said. “but I truly believe that keeping 2.2 million people in an open-air prison will create radicalism.”
Benedix stressed that her organization supports the right of pro-Palestinian students and faculty to voice their views in public, but pushed back against a number of the event’s talking points.
“What my concern is when I hear the term ‘genocide’ and actually several of these slogans that we’re hearing and all the inflammatory language, is that it is something that’s meant to engage raw emotion without context,” she said. Blame for the month of violence, she said, belongs squarely on Hamas, whose violence she described as “animalistic and barbaric.”
“I would challenge anyone to say that those actions can be justified by anything,” she said. “We’re not talking about the civilians. We’re talking about the people that did these horrific actions.”
It is incumbent on the militant group, she said, to end the violence by returning Israeli hostages.
Jewish voices have long been among the most prominent on both sides of debates in the United States over American support for the Israeli government — the U.S. supplies Israel with more than $3.8 annually in military aid — which have become increasingly heated in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks and. On Oct. 18, the pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League — one of the nation’s oldest Jewish civil rights groups — issued a condemnation of Jewish pro-Palestinian protesters who occupied the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building in Washington to demand a cease-fire. President Joe Biden has staunchly resisted such calls and has pledged “rock solid and unwavering” support for Israel.
Ruth Needleman, a professor of labor studies at IUN, invoked her own Jewish identity in condemning Israel’s attacks on Gaza at Thursday’s event.
“I have no identification with Israel. It’s not my country. They don’t speak for me and they don’t speak for the majority of Jews in the world,” Needleman said. “To attack the policies of the government of Israel is to be against genocide, not to be anti-Semitic.”
An IUN spokesperson did not comment on the event’s content, and wrote in a statement that it “was not university-sponsored.”
“It was conducted in accordance with normal procedures for events in that venue, which encourage the free and civil exchange of ideas,” she wrote.

Full text: The Israel-Hamas war has been deadly for reporters trying to cover the violence that has claimed more than 10,000 lives, including at least 39 journalists and media workers killed so far in Gaza, Israel and Lebanon in the first month of fighting.
The rising death toll for members of the media unfolded as the United Nations marked the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists on Nov. 2 with a stark warning that reporters around the world are increasingly under attack as they cover not just war but also everything from elections to protests and riots.
While so many civilians are dying in the war-torn Gaza strip, it may seem like a side issue to focus on journalist deaths, but it isn't. Members of the news media risking their lives to shine a light on what's happening in Gaza are among the only independent voices bringing reports from the rubble that aren't coming just from official sources in Israel or Hamas. Also, tragically, for many journalists killed in the Gaza war, multiple members of their families died with them.
What's more, the media are not just at risk in war and crises. UNESCO released a report chronicling a dramatic increase in violations of media freedom by law enforcement agencies across the globe that have led in some cases to deaths and injuries for journalists trying to cover protests.
Attacks against journalists covering protests, public demonstrations and riots were registered by UNESCO in at least 101 countries from January 2015 to August 2021, and since 2015, at least 13 journalists have been killed in such attacks, according to the UNESCO issue brief.
Moreover, assaults on reporters related to their covering elections were also widespread, with UNESCO registering 759 attacks against journalists and media professionals -- including nine killings -- in at least 89 elections in 70 countries around the world from January 2019 to June 2022, according to the report. Forty-two percent of those attacks were made by law enforcement agents, the report said.
This should sound familiar to Americans who saw members of independent media attacked and threatened by supporters of then-President Donald Trump during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the nation's Capitol. It should be a warning, as well, of potential violence facing media during next year's presidential campaign and general election
Journalists are dying at a staggering rate in the war in Gaza, but the killing of journalists was already on the rise before Hamas committed bloody atrocities against Israelis on Oct. 7 and touched off the latest Israel-Hamas conflict.
Journalist deaths rose to a new high last year, when 88 lost their lives across the globe, mainly in Russia's war on Ukraine, but also in hot spots such as Mexico, the Philippines and Pakistan. Foreign correspondents bringing home objective coverage of these crises help Americans -- and citizens of other nations -- decide what policies, causes and funding to support.
The report also outlines the use by police and security forces of nonlethal methods -- rubber-coated steel bullets, pepper balls and other crowd control measures -- that often result in injuries to journalists. It also notes the majority of attacks on media covering protests are made by security forces, who often arrest, beat or humiliate reporters as well.
Their job is incredibly important and impactful in democracies, shining a light in places where, otherwise, people would be dying in darkness. They should not have to die to do it.
"Journalists must not be threatened, targeted with attacks or prevented from reporting freely at any time," said Tawfik Jelassi, UNESCO's assistant director-general for communications and information, marking the release of the UNESCO report. "We call on governments to take extra measures to protect journalists' safety and to guarantee the right to freedom of expression and access to information, including during electoral periods. These two fundamental human rights are critical to the functioning of democracy."
Last December, UNESCO released a report about other growing threats to silence news media professionals or impede their freedom of expression, including the "misuse" of judicial systems to attack press freedoms by expanding criminal and civil defamation measures, as well as intimidating lawsuits aimed at stifling free expression. It is incumbent on democratic governments and societies everywhere to heed the U.N.'s warnings and redouble efforts to fight back by demanding more protections for media and by insisting on more accountability for governments.
Even as America seeks to support allies embroiled in wars in Europe and the Middle East, the U.S. and other democratic nations must advance stronger policies, laws and litigation of their own to defend international standards for freedom of speech against growing threats to journalists and laws that criminalize expression.
The latest UNESCO report lays out recommendations for how governments can combat the problem, including providing better training of law enforcement agencies to work with journalists more collaboratively, understand their role and help keep them safe.
Americans should not be naive about this. The world is a dangerous place, and journalists have traditionally gone into harm's way to cover the stories their readers and viewers need to know. That's always been part of the job journalists accept. We know the risks.
But the number of journalists dying on the job -- or at home when their world comes under assault by terrorists or aerial bombardment -- is alarming, and it is growing disturbingly higher all the time. Truth is always the first casualty in war, but reporters are civilians and must not be targets.
Democracies that trumpet a free press and champion freedom of expression need to do a better job honoring those values by protecting journalists.

Filmmakers' lenses on human cost of Israel-Hamas war

Full text: I watched a brilliant and heartbreaking short film the other day, posted online by the New Yorker magazine as part of its story of filmmaker Yahav Winner, killed Oct. 7 in the Hamas extremists' massacre of Israeli citizens.
Several times, for many reasons, I've returned to that film, titled "The Boy," to imagine the career Winner might've had; to marvel at the patient, precise rightness of every visual decision he made; and to help an outsider, me, comprehend a conflict with a now-remote start and no foreseeable finish. Meantime, the Israel-Hamas war's death toll includes an estimated 1,400 Israelis and more than 10,000 Palestinians. In a month.
"The Boy" is available on YouTube. It is 25 minutes long, and it is as wide as a humane filmmaker's eyes can open.
It takes place where Winner lived with his filmmaker wife, Shaylee Atary, and their infant daughter: the Kfar Aza kibbutz a few kilometers, as relayed in New Yorker contributor Daniel Lombroso's Oct. 27 feature, from the razor wire marking the Israel-Gaza divide. "The Boy" tells a fictional story of a young man, Barak (Nimrod Peleg), a war veteran now living at home again in a profoundly unsteady state of mind.
He is never far from the sounds of machine gunfire, or periodic Code Red warning sirens and the latest explosions not necessarily close yet never distant enough for comfort. At one point, Barak, at home at night watching a reality TV show with his parents and brother, is visibly shaken by another bomb going off in the vicinity.
Don't worry, says his tired father played with subtle anguish by Yoram Toledano. "It's ours."
From there writer-director Winner takes "The Boy" deeper inside its title character's traumatized state. Clinical and narrative details remain scant regarding his condition and combat travails. The sheer strangeness of life along this border, a time of relative peace but ever-threatening conflict when Winner filmed his project, fills the spare storyline to the brim, without thesis statements or polemics. As Winner's widow Atary told the New Yorker: The young man in "The Boy" exists in a state of benumbed heartbreak, because "he knows people are (just) like him on the other side of the fence."
Late in the film, Barak's father exhorts his son to come home with him and try to sleep. "I don't want to wake up," Barak says, through tears.
"You've got to," the father replies with a hint of pleading. The exchange carries an echo of Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot," which includes the lines:
"I can't go on like this."
"That's what you think."
These words of existential lament and human resignation know no borders.
What Barak can only imagine going on in Gaza becomes vivid in the hands of other filmmakers. In the 24-minute-long Oscar-nominated short "The Present" (2020), a Palestinian father (Saleh Bakri) and his preteen daughter (Maryam Kanj) embark on a shopping trip in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The father's mission: to buy his wife a new refrigerator -- not a romantic anniversary gift, he realizes, but badly needed.
Now streaming on Netflix, "The Present" is a film of obstacles. Director and co-writer Farah Nabulsi, a British Palestinian filmmaker, filmed on location partly, without permission from the Israeli authorities, at Bethlehem's Checkpoint 300. The story's depiction of the imperious, bullying Israeli soldiers will not please Israelis. But Nabulsi did not set out with appeasement in mind.
"I wanted to tell a human story about a very cruel reality," Nabulsi told a France 24 TV interviewer. Three years after she made "The Present," the present has become prologue for a war with no end in sight.
A month prior to the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, Nabulsi's first feature, "The Teacher," a drama about a Palestinian educator's crisis of political conscience, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. "The Boy" director Winner never got that far. The Times of Israel's obituary noted that Winner's debut feature project went unfinished at the time of his death at the hands of Hamas extremists.
His feature, as he told one interviewer, took place in the village where he lived and was to be an examination of "the constant conflict that exists in you when you look over the fence at what is happening in Gaza." The conflict, he said -- ultimately costing him his life, while he managed to save his wife and daughter -- is "traumatic because it has no solution, but within all of this there is comfort within the personal connections."
This is what cinema can do if we let it. It provides connections between the lives on screen and lives like ours, and not like ours.
As Gaza transforms into a "graveyard for children," in the Nov. 6 words of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, as the fate of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas grows more uncertain, it seems faintly ludicrous to seek answers, or meaning, from a movie searching for the same. And yet I do, lately. Art shapes history, and has a way of indicating where we're headed, for good or ill.
"The Boy" and "The Present" are merely two of hundreds of films, nonfiction, fiction, short or long, provoked by a geopolitical conflict that is now, once again, a war in flames and despair, and once again tearing people apart.
These two films are not front line dispatches. Nor are they justifications of slaughter. They work very differently, to different ends. But both serve as distillations of lives unfolding in a realm of appalling everyday reality.
If we can't accept a politically and morally complicated Israeli response to that reality, then "The Boy" has nothing to say to us. If we can't accept a depiction of the routine indignities of Palestinian life under Israeli military rule, then "The Present" is just emotional propaganda. And if we can? Then we can at least argue about the barbarism and hopelessness like human beings.
"The Boy" and "The Present" predate the current Israeli-Hamas carnage, but they're full of portents. The films don't talk to each other, exactly, but their respective filmmakers share a yearning for what, for now, remains unattainable. A dream.
Last week, The Guardian ran an interview with Winner's fellow Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman, who made the haunting "Waltz with Bashir," about Folman's firsthand experiences in the 1982 Lebanon War. Folman finds the Western media's reporting on the viciousness of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre to be "hypocritical." The filmmaker also said that after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's retaliatory escalation of missile strikes on Gaza, leaving 10,000 dead so far, Netanyahu "will never stay in power now."
Folman added: "I still believe there is going to be a solution here. All my life, I had this feeling that after a massive catastrophe (like Oct. 7), there would be new order here in the Middle East." He concluded with a line that sounds very much like "Waiting for Godot" relocated to a different place and time: "We can't go on living like this."
Both "The Present" and "The Boy" dramatize that same declaration -- complicated by the awful prospect that we probably can.
"The Boy" is streaming on YouTube courtesy of New Yorker magazine. "The Present" is streaming on Netflix and available on other platforms.

Full text: I watched a brilliant and heartbreaking short film the other day, posted online by the New Yorker magazine as part of its story of filmmaker Yahav Winner, killed Oct. 7 in the Hamas extremists’ massacre of Israeli citizens.
Several times, for many reasons, I’ve returned to that film, titled “The Boy,” to imagine the career Winner might’ve had; to marvel at the patient, precise rightness of every visual decision he made; and to help an outsider, me, comprehend a conflict with a now-remote start and no foreseeable finish.

And yet I do, lately. Art shapes history, and has a way of indicating where we’re headed, for good or ill.
“The Boy” and “The Present” are merely two of hundreds of films, nonfiction, fiction, short or long, provoked by a geopolitical conflict that is now, once again, a war in flames and despair, and once again tearing people apart.
These two films are not front line dispatches. Nor are they justifications of slaughter. They work very differently, to different ends. But both serve as distillations of lives unfolding in a realm of appalling everyday reality.
If we can’t accept a politically and morally complicated Israeli response to that reality, then “The Boy” has nothing to say to us. If we can’t accept a depiction of the routine indignities of Palestinian life under Israeli military rule, then “The Present” is just emotional propaganda. And if we can? Then we can at least argue about the barbarism and hopelessness like human beings.
“The Boy” and “The Present” predate the current Israeli-Hamas carnage, but they’re full of portents. The films don’t talk to each other, exactly, but their respective filmmakers share a yearning for what, for now, remains unattainable. A dream.
Last week, The Guardian ran an interview with Winner’s fellow Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman, who made the haunting “Waltz with Bashir,” about Folman’s firsthand experiences in the 1982 Lebanon War. Folman finds the Western media’s reporting on the viciousness of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre to be “hypocritical.” The filmmaker also said that after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s retaliatory escalation of missile strikes on Gaza, leaving 10,000 dead so far, Netanyahu “will never stay in power now.”
Folman added: “I still believe there is going to be a solution here. All my life, I had this feeling that after a massive catastrophe (like Oct. 7), there would be new order here in the Middle East.” He concluded with a line that sounds very much like “Waiting for Godot” relocated to a different place and time: “We can’t go on living like this.”
Both “The Present” and “The Boy” dramatize that same declaration — complicated by the awful prospect that we probably can.
“The Boy” is streaming on YouTube courtesy of New Yorker magazine. “The Present” is streaming on Netflix and available on other platforms.

Full text: I watched a brilliant and heartbreaking short film the other day, posted online by the New Yorker magazine as part of its story of filmmaker Yahav Winner, killed Oct. 7 in the Hamas extremists’ massacre of Israeli citizens.
Several times, for many reasons, I’ve returned to that film, titled “The Boy,” to imagine the career Winner might’ve had; to marvel at the patient, precise rightness of every visual decision he made; and to help an outsider, me, comprehend a conflict with a now-remote start and no foreseeable finish. Meantime, the Israel-Hamas war’s death toll includes an estimated 1,400 Israelis and more than 10,000 Palestinians. In a month.
“The Boy” is available on YouTube. It is 25 minutes long, and it is as wide as a humane filmmaker’s eyes can open.
It takes place where Winner lived with his filmmaker wife, Shaylee Atary, and their infant daughter: the Kfar Aza kibbutz a few kilometers, as relayed in New Yorker contributor Daniel Lombroso’s Oct. 27 feature, from the razor wire marking the Israel-Gaza divide. “The Boy” tells a fictional story of a young man, Barak (Nimrod Peleg), a war veteran now living at home again in a profoundly unsteady state of mind.
He is never far from the sounds of machine gunfire, or periodic Code Red warning sirens and the latest explosions not necessarily close yet never distant enough for comfort. At one point, Barak, at home at night watching a reality TV show with his parents and brother, is visibly shaken by another bomb going off in the vicinity.
Don’t worry, says his tired father played with subtle anguish by Yoram Toledano. “It’s ours.”
From there writer-director Winner takes “The Boy” deeper inside its title character’s traumatized state. Clinical and narrative details remain scant regarding his condition and combat travails. The sheer strangeness of life along this border, a time of relative peace but ever-threatening conflict when Winner filmed his project, fills the spare storyline to the brim, without thesis statements or polemics. As Winner’s widow Atary told the New Yorker: The young man in “The Boy” exists in a state of benumbed heartbreak, because “he knows people are (just) like him on the other side of the fence.”
Late in the film, Barak’s father exhorts his son to come home with him and try to sleep. “I don’t want to wake up,” Barak says, through tears.
“You’ve got to,” the father replies with a hint of pleading. The exchange carries an echo of Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” which includes the lines:
“I can’t go on like this.”
“That’s what you think.”
These words of existential lament and human resignation know no borders.
What Barak can only imagine going on in Gaza becomes vivid in the hands of other filmmakers. In the 24-minute-long Oscar-nominated short “The Present” (2020), a Palestinian father (Saleh Bakri) and his preteen daughter (Maryam Kanj) embark on a shopping trip in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The father’s mission: to buy his wife a new refrigerator — not a romantic anniversary gift, he realizes, but badly needed.
Now streaming on Netflix, “The Present” is a film of obstacles. Director and co-writer Farah Nabulsi, a British Palestinian filmmaker, filmed on location partly, without permission from the Israeli authorities, at Bethlehem’s Checkpoint 300. The story’s depiction of the imperious, bullying Israeli soldiers will not please Israelis. But Nabulsi did not set out with appeasement in mind.
“I wanted to tell a human story about a very cruel reality,” Nabulsi told a France 24 TV interviewer. Three years after she made “The Present,” the present has become prologue for a war with no end in sight.
A month prior to the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, Nabulsi’s first feature, “The Teacher,” a drama about a Palestinian educator’s crisis of political conscience, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. “The Boy” director Winner never got that far. The Times of Israel’s obituary noted that Winner’s debut feature project went unfinished at the time of his death at the hands of Hamas extremists.
His feature, as he told one interviewer, took place in the village where he lived and was to be an examination of “the constant conflict that exists in you when you look over the fence at what is happening in Gaza.” The conflict, he said — ultimately costing him his life, while he managed to save his wife and daughter — is “traumatic because it has no solution, but within all of this there is comfort within the personal connections.”
This is what cinema can do if we let it. It provides connections between the lives on screen and lives like ours, and not like ours.
As Gaza transforms into a “graveyard for children,” in the Nov. 6 words of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, as the fate of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas grows more uncertain, it seems faintly ludicrous to seek answers, or meaning, from a movie searching for the same. And yet I do, lately. Art shapes history, and has a way of indicating where we’re headed, for good or ill.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A majority of the Senate Democratic caucus called on President Joe Biden on Wednesday to defend his request for $14.3 billion in emergency military assistance for Israel, seeking assurances that the Jewish state has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and that the United States will not be funding actions that run afoul of international and U.S. laws.
In a letter to the president, 24 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them asked for details on how the administration planned to guarantee that Israel was properly mitigating civilian casualties in Gaza. They also asked for Biden's assessment of whether Israel's plans to oust Hamas from the Gaza Strip were achievable militarily, whether those plans were taking the fate of hostages into account and whether the country's plan for governing the territory after the war was viable.
The letter represents the first broad challenge that Biden has faced from members of his own party over his administration's plans to help Israel wage a war against Hamas, through assaults on Gaza that commenced after the group brutally attacked civilians and soldiers in southern Israel on Oct. 7.
It was spearheaded by Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who has been one of the most vocal senators urging administration officials to address the plight of Palestinian civilians. Signatories also include leading Democrats such as Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the party's No. 2 in the chamber, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, reflecting that concern about Israel's actions -- and Biden's support for them -- goes beyond the progressive left.
The senators drew a distinction between defensive aid for Israel, for which they expressed unequivocal support, and military assistance that would go toward furthering Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, about which they raised significant questions.
"We believe the United States should immediately provide Israel with the funding it needs to replenish its defensive systems, including Iron Dome and other air defense capabilities," the group wrote. "But to better understand the efficacy of U.S. funding that supports Israel's operations inside Gaza, we respectfully ask your team to provide us with information relative to these two clear U.S. priorities: supporting an Israeli strategy that will effectively degrade and defeat the threat from Hamas and taking all possible measures to protect civilians in Gaza."
In the letter, Senate Democrats asked for information about "what specific mechanisms you are putting in place to ensure that Israeli military operations conducted inside Gaza are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law and to ensure that any U.S.-provided equipment is used in a manner consistent with U.S. law."
The senators specifically requested an assessment of whether Israel's military rules of engagement, particularly regarding mitigating civilian casualties, are in line with U.S. policy and practice.
White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the letter.

Israel asked Egypt to take Gazans: Diplomats confirm proposal, but idea dismissed by many

Full text: Israel has quietly tried to build international support in recent weeks for the transfer of several hundred thousand civilians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt for the duration of its war in the territory, according to six senior foreign diplomats.
Israeli leaders and diplomats have privately proposed the idea to several foreign governments, framing it as a humanitarian initiative that would allow civilians to temporarily escape the perils of Gaza for refugee camps in the Sinai Desert, just across the border in neighboring Egypt.
The suggestion was dismissed by most of Israel's interlocutors -- who include the United States and Britain -- because of the risk that such a mass displacement could become permanent.
These countries fear that such a development might destabilize Egypt and lock significant numbers of Palestinians out of their homeland, according to the diplomats, who spoke anonymously in order to discuss such a sensitive matter more freely.
The idea has also been firmly rejected by Palestinians, who fear that Israel is using the war -- which began Oct. 7 after terrorists from Gaza raided Israel and killed roughly 1,400 people -- to permanently displace the more than 2 million people living in Gaza.
More than 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding the creation of the state in 1948. Many of their descendants are now warning that the current war will end with a similar "nakba," or catastrophe, as the 1948 migration is known in Arabic.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment on the proposal.
Days after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that oversees Gaza, the Israeli military called for all residents of northern Gaza -- about half the entire population of the territory -- to evacuate to southern Gaza as it prepared for a ground invasion.
But Israel did not publicly suggest that Palestinians cross the Egyptian border, which has been largely sealed since the start of the war.
Egypt has rejected the idea of a temporary displacement, let alone a permanent one.
A spokesperson for the Egyptian government declined to comment, referring instead to a speech made last month by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi that dismissed idea.
"Egypt has affirmed and reiterated its complete rejection of the forced displacement of Palestinians and their exodus to Egyptian lands in Sinai, as this is nothing but a final liquidation of the Palestinian cause," el-Sissi said in a speech published on his website.
Some of Netanyahu's political allies, however, have publicly backed the idea of temporarily moving large numbers of Palestinians to Egypt as well as to other countries in the region and in the West.
Danny Danon, a lawmaker from Netanyahu's Likud party and a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said he supported evacuating civilians in Gaza to give Israel more room to maneuver during its ground invasion of Gaza and to move civilians out of harm's way.
"We're trying to lower the level of casualties for our troops and for the civilians," Danon said in a phone interview. "We expect not only the Egyptians, but the entire international community to make a genuine effort to support and accept the residents of Gaza."
Danon added that the idea would need the agreement of the Egyptian government, which controls Gaza's southern border.
However, Danon is not a member of the government and could not confirm whether Israel had been pushing foreign governments to back such a plan.
Israel's diplomatic push has added to a growing sense of uncertainty about what will happen if Israel takes control over parts or all of Gaza, even temporarily, at the end of its military operations.
Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza on Oct. 27, nearly three weeks after Hamas overran parts of southern Israel.
Israel's stated goals are the dismantling of Hamas and the rescue of more than 240 civilians and soldiers captured by the group and its allies on Oct. 7.
But Israeli officials have repeatedly said they are still assessing who should lead the enclave once those goals are achieved.
One proposal is to cede Gaza to an international force that could then help reconstruct its infrastructure and housing before handing it to the Palestinian Authority, a more moderate Palestinian institution that administers parts of the occupied West Bank. But the authority has said that it does not want to take over the territory unless Israel allows the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.
Israel captured Gaza from Egypt during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and established 21 Jewish settlements there.
But in 2005, the Israeli government dismantled those settlements, evacuated their residents to Israel, and handed the territory to the Palestinian Authority.
Hamas forced out the authority two years later, leading Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on the strip that has been in place for the past 16 years.

Full text: After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that has subsequently erupted into the Israel-Hamas war, some Skokie residents put up yard signs affirming support for Israel. Last week, Skokie Police said some of those signs were targeted and destroyed, which they determined to be a hate crime.
Skokie police said 10 locations near Church Street and Kostner Avenue had signs that said “We Stand with Israel,” with images of both the U.S. and Israeli flags, destroyed in the early morning of Nov. 3. Sergeant Brandi Shelton said no one is in custody and police are investigating the matter.
Rabbi Shaanan Gelman of the Kehilat Chovevei Tzion synagogue in Skokie told Pioneer Press that many of the neighbors that had their signs destroyed belong to his congregation.
“It’s quite jarring; people are scared,” he said.
Gelman said members of his synagogue were scared to put their signs up in support of Israel in the first place, citing rising antisemitic incidents across the U.S. and Chicago. “Antisemites are approaching our peaceful rallies. They’re shouting, attacking [and] surrounding people, threatening their lives,” said Gelman.
Paul Sassieni, a member of Gelman’s congregation and a Skokie resident who lives on the block where the yards signs were ripped up, said when he walked out of his home last week, the remains of the signs on front lawns were “disturbing.”
“Whoever took them down is obviously intolerant of other people’s views,” said Sassieni. He also pointed out that because of the way that they were destroyed, he believed that a box cutter was used.
Sassieni said he didn’t have a yard sign himself, but he had a mezuzah, a religious object nailed to the front post of his yard, vandalized. He said it’s possible that the two incidents were unrelated, and he doesn’t have proof that the same people who ripped the signs also destroyed his mezuzah. Regardless, he said the act was antisemitic.
Gelman said this type of incident and escalation is akin in some ways to Kristallnacht, a violent event in Nazi Germany in 1938, in which Nazis vandalized Jewish homes and targeted Jews, many of whom were killed. It escalated Nazi Germany’s antisemitic treatment of and attitudes toward Jews in the year before the Nazis invaded Poland, which started World War II.
“The Germans called for the destruction and, ultimately, the extermination of all the Jews. And that’s exactly what’s in the Hamas charter,” said Gelman.
Gelman added, “The Hamas charter calls for the extermination of Jews the world over. And so when they ripped down our signs, it’s not vandalism, it is a hate crime, and it cuts deep.”
After the signs were destroyed, Sassieni said he was interested in posting one on his lawn, saying that he was not intimidated by the actions to destroy the signs. He said he has already heard neighbors talk about ordering more signs.
“Hopefully, more people put out these lawn signs expressing solidarity with Israel, and I will be one of them,” said Sassieni.
Police are asking if anyone has information regarding the incident to contact the Skokie Police Department at (847) 982-5900.

Full text: Israel, under attack from murderous Hamas terrorists, needs American financial and military support, even as the beleaguered civilian population of Gaza deserves humanitarian help: Republicans in Congress entirely agree with President Biden and Democrats there. They are all together on the urgency to send assistance to Israel battling against Hamas.
Where Republicans break with Biden -- or at least a significant slice of them under the thrall of former President Donald Trump do -- is in also aiding Ukraine, which has been under brutal attack from Russia for a year and eight months. Against all expectations, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rallied Ukrainians to fend off Moscow's invasion.
The consequences are quite clear: Should America give up on Ukraine, Ukraine will fall to Vladimir Putin's forces, and the message will be clear that the strong can gobble the weak even when the world says no. The message will be sent that despite endless strident statements about how morally unacceptable it is for one country to invade a sovereign neighbor, if you wait long enough -- less than two years -- the world will lose its will and accept the supposedly unacceptable. ...
New Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is intent on separating the two requests for foreign aid, Israel and Ukraine. Moreover, Johnson proposes paying for the aid to Israel by slashing tens of billions of dollars in funding for more robust IRS enforcement, an asinine, ideologically motivated push that will forfeit much more revenue than it "saves." ...
Either Johnson and Republicans should accept a single, combined bill helping Israel and Ukraine alike in their moment of need, or they should commit to bringing both bills to the House floor, even if that means their passage will depend in part on Democratic votes.

How will Israel's security concerns affect Palestinian statehood?

Full text: As war rages between Israel and Hamas, the latest news reports speak of the possibility of placing troops from the United States, United Kingdom and France in Gaza after the war as part of a multinational peacekeeping force.
Yet, such forces run the risk of being seen as colonialist and meeting the rage of the Palestinian population, similarly to how U.S. and U.K. forces were seen in Iraq. Ultimately, the most just solution would be for Palestinians to govern themselves through a Palestinian state in Gaza.
A hurdle to this idea comes in the form of the Palestinian prime minister's recent statement that the Palestinian Authority would take control of Gaza after the war only if there's a "comprehensive" solution that includes the West Bank.
Surely, Mohammad Shtayyeh's statement is consistent with the Oslo Accords and the process that was started in 1993. Back then, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat requested of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that any Israeli concessions toward Palestinians include not only Gaza but also the West Bank. Israel agreed by putting Jericho, a city in the West Bank, under Palestinian administration. This "Jericho first" model was followed by the awarding of internal administration to all the major Palestinian cities in the West Bank.
Israel's acquiescence resulted in the West Bank becoming embedded in the global conscience as part of a future Palestinian state. In the Oslo years, no one placed a serious emphasis on working out how a Palestinian state flanking Israel on both sides would be accommodated from a security perspective. During times of aspiration toward peace, the assumption was that such a Palestinian state would peacefully cooperate with the Jewish one. Ideas were even proposed for a safe passage to be created that would cross Israel and enable the free transport of people and goods from Gaza and the West Bank.
Today's war proves that these ideas must be shelved. Even if Hamas is beaten, there are no guarantees it will not return the way the Taliban militia reestablished itself once the U.S. left Afghanistan. And even if Hamas does not return to Gaza, it can return to the West Bank, where polls currently predict its victory in future elections.
From a security perspective, Israel cannot live with the possible reemergence of Hamas -- to its west or east. The current war has changed many things, including Israel's security needs. United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 speaks about "land for peace," and it equally speaks about the need for Israel to exist within "secure and recognized boundaries." The country must emphasize this security aspect in any future discussions on the creation of the Palestinian state.
This means that when it comes to the Gaza Strip, Israel must be there to ensure -- this time earnestly and effectively -- that no rockets and weaponry enter Gaza. This will require the construction of a port off the Gaza coast where goods would arrive, get inspected and then enter Gaza. Such an idea has been on the table in the past; it's expected to resurface.
When it comes to the West Bank, emphasis on Israel's security means that the Palestinians may ultimately find themselves facing an internationally backed proposal in which they exercise their right to self-determination through independence in Gaza and through autonomy in the West Bank. Palestinians in the West Bank would enjoy free movement and socioeconomic rights in Israel and the administration of everyday matters from their own authorities, and they would send representatives to sit in the parliament of the Palestinian state in Gaza. This arrangement would ensure that West Bank Palestinians would not live under any kind of apartheid and, furthermore, the conditions for such apartheid would not be begotten in the first place.
Ehud Barak, onetime Israeli prime minister, argued for the need for the Israeli army to retain control of the West Bank even after the creation of a Palestinian state. Whereas in other matters, Barak, the architect of the 2000 summit of U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders, has been seen as a failed prime minister, it seems he is right on this specific topic.
Unless history and the Middle East peace process are seen through an out of the box approach, any future political initiatives, even if they involve the establishment of a Palestinian state, will not be enough to avert further bloodshed in the years to come.

Full text: More than three weeks after she was taken hostage by Hamas operatives, 18-year-old Natalie Raanan is finally sleeping in her own bed.
The Evanston teen was taken hostage from the Nahal Oz kibbutz in southern Israel Oct. 7 along with her mother Judith Raanan, 59. The mother and daughter were released into Red Cross custody, then into Israel, on Oct. 20.
Yinam Cohen, consul general of Israel to the Midwest, said Monday evening that Natalie had just arrived in Chicago. Judith is still in Israel, he told the Tribune.
"I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago," Cohen said in a statement Monday night. "Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness."
Cohen declined to comment on Natalie's condition, saying the family has requested privacy in the coming days.
Cohen also declined to comment on the logistics of Natalie's return and what her plans are for her first few days home.
Uri Raanan, Natalie's father and Judith's ex-husband, lives in Bannockburn with his wife and stepdaughter.
Uri had said that when Natalie returned to the Chicago area, the family would hold a belated celebration at his home for Natalie's 18th birthday.
Natalie spent 10 days in Israel recuperating after her release from Hamas on Oct. 20.
When she turned 18 on Oct. 24, Israeli friends and family shared a birthday cake frosted with elaborate pink flowers and gold nonpareils.
Hamas is a terrorist organization, currently controlling the Gaza strip. Natalie told family in Israel that she was not harmed physically by Hamas operatives, retaining access to food, water, fresh clothes and a shower, a family friend told the Tribune.
Natalie's last visit to Israel was four years ago. This trip, she planned to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Simhat Torah, as well as her grandmother Tamar's 85th birthday.
The Raanan family has been in touch with at least one other family of a hostage, Uri told reporters Oct. 20, speaking often with an American woman whose grandson is still being held captive.
"We've been talking a couple times and we've been praying for their return," Uri Raanan said.
Natalie graduated from Deerfield High School in the spring and arrived in Israel earlier in October after a trip to Italy. She had planned to spend several months traveling in Israel, also visiting Egypt, before studying fashion design, interior decorating or tattooing.
In a statement last week, Deerfield High School Principal Kathryn Anderson shared wishes for Natalie and Judith's safe passage back to the Chicago area.
"The entire District 113 community are thrilled with the news that DHS graduate Natalie Raanan and her mother have been released," Anderson said.
Uri Raanan has raised more than $10,000 toward Natalie and Judith's recovery. Chabad of Evanston started a second fundraising campaign in anticipation of Natalie's homecoming. Community members have contributed more than $12,000 so far.
"So many people lovingly reached out, asking how they can participate in welcoming Judith & Natalie home; and supporting their material and emotional needs as they transition home," Chabad staff wrote on Facebook.
While Natalie's arrival is an occasion for joy, Cohen stressed that this is still a time of mourning for the consulate, and that community advocacy efforts for other hostages continue.
"While we're celebrating their coming home, we still remember the 239 hostages that are still held by Hamas in the Gaza strip away from their families," Cohen told the Tribune on Tuesday.
The consulate continues to demand the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas, Cohen said. Those still held in Gaza represent more than 25 countries, including Argentina, Germany, France, Russia and Thailand.
"Many of them have lost their family members during the terrorist attack, among them more than 30 children," Cohen said. "This is a very pressing humanitarian issue."
The Raanans are the only American hostages to have been released by Hamas from Gaza. Since Oct. 20, Hamas operatives have released two Israeli women, and confirmed the identity of three more hostages featured in a propaganda video.
Israeli Defense Forces announced early this week that they had extracted hostage Ori Megidish, 19 -- an IDF private -- during a ground operation in the Gaza strip.
The Israeli minister of foreign affairs also confirmed the death of 22-year-old hostage Shani Louk on Monday with a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Louk, a German and Israeli dual citizen, was kidnapped by Hamas from the Tribe of Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7.
Three family members of Hamas hostages will travel to Chicago this week to meet with community members as they continue to advocate for their loved ones.
The relatives will attend a vigil Wednesday at Anshe Emet Synagogue in Chicago, and a second vigil Thursday at North Suburban Synagogue Beth El in Highland Park.

Full text: It's too much. Too much heartbreak. Too much fear. Too much anger. Too much hopelessness. I don't know how to feel all these feelings at once.
I'm drowning in my own sadness, my anxieties, my anger and dread. Every time I come back to the surface and catch my breath, I'm pushed back down by the unbearable weight of collective grief and horror and fear. I can't wake up from the nightmare of those first days after the attacks on Oct. 7 as the headlines rolled and the country reeled -- another hour, another hundred bodies counted, another missing person added to the list of the abducted, another friend called up to serve.
I'm terrified. Terrified that the feeble barrier that's been protecting my family from danger in our home in central Israel will break, or that there is no barrier at all, that it's just an illusion. Terrified that we can no longer safely believe that our military might and our intelligence and our sophisticated defense systems can keep us safe. Terrified that when we wake up from the nightmare, this crazy place is going to have fallen off the precipice, beyond the point of no return. Terrified that the last faint ember of hope for justice and security and peace for us and our Palestinian neighbors will have finally burned out. That hate and resentment will be the only things that remain.
And I feel guilty. Guilty for my privilege. I live in a place where I can let my kids go and play in the yard because, if we hear a siren, we have 90 seconds to get to a shelter (90 seconds and not 60 or 30 or 15). Just far enough away from Gaza that rockets are less likely to land here and underground tunnels can't easily reach here. Just far enough from the sea. Just far enough from the Lebanese and Syrian borders.
And if it turns out that I'm not far enough away, I have another home. I could always just pack up my life and move back to an easier place. I'm privileged that none of my immediate relatives had to put on a uniform and run headfirst into the inferno. I'm privileged that none of my immediate relatives has met an unspeakable horror. I'm privileged that not a single one of the cacophony of fighter jets flying overhead is armed with explosives aimed at my house. Everything is happening just outside my small, insulated life.
I'm devastated. Crushed that this is how it had to go down. The terrorists won, and the rest of us lost. Everyone in this loud, hot, cramped corner of the globe is losing. Likewise, everyone on the outside who is at all connected to this place. Everyone in the world who dreams of an independent Palestine alongside an independent Israel is losing. Sanity and patience and tolerance are losing. Only the haters are winning. They will come out of this feeling vindicated and self-righteous. The rest of us will be left with our fear, burying our dead and licking our wounds.
How did we get here? Why can't we talk to each other anymore? How have we let the voices of reason get drowned out by all this hate?
I'm angry. Angry that the people acting in my name don't share my dream of a just and sensible outcome. Angry that the people acting in the name of Palestinian rights have been hijacked by murderers. Angry that we're looking at each other and seeing the demons we each conjured with our own fear and mistrust.
Israel is my personal and collective homeland, but I have never had an easy relationship with it. I've been the scornful, judgmental child, not withholding my disapproval and disdain. I've been the ashamed, distant child, attempting to dissociate myself as much as possible. I've been the angry, rebellious child, screaming out my hate and resentment, lashing out with all the vitriol I can muster.
Through all of it, though, I just can't shake this place. Can't just walk away. So I'm stuck here, crying these endless tears, feeling all the feelings.
I'm just so tired.
